Slaven Bilic likens returning Dimitri Payet to Arsenal’s Mesut Özil
~CONTENTS~
Dimitri Payet, whom Slaven Bilic likened to Arsenal’s Mesut Özil, is fit for Saturday’s game against Liverpool at Upton Park. Whether the West Ham playmaker will start is dependent on how he performs in training but his rapid recovery from the ankle injury he sustained in November means he will almost certainly make the squad.Payet was instrumental in West Ham’s strong start to the season and Bilic was full of praise for the France midfielder. “I rate him on the same level as Mesut Özil. He makes other players better. He creates space for others, he creates chances, he can take three or four players out of the game,” the manager said. “He adapted immediately to the club and the players recognised his ability straight away.”West Ham United v Liverpool: match preview Read moreWhen asked whether Payet’s early-season form had gone unnoticed, Bilic said: “Definitely. He would have got more headlines if he was at Chelsea, Manchester United or Liverpool. His return is a great boost for us and he will be involved in the game.”The former Marseille player has been directly involved in eight goals in his 12 Premier League appearances. Last week the West Ham co-chairman David Sullivan said he “was the best player I’ve signed in 25 years. He’s a £30m player”.West Ham also have Victor Moses and Winston Reid back in training, although Saturday’s match will probably come too soon for them. The left-back Aaron Cresswell should be fit to play after a hamstring scan showed he had not picked up a serious injury. That means Diafra Sakho is the only remaining long-term absentee.Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekend Read moreWith several players returning before the transfer window, Bilic was keen to stress he was happy with the squad” and is not expecting a very active month. “We are not looking to improve our squad with a number of players,” he said. “But if something exceptional comes up, then of course it’s a possibility.”Another player who has made a substantial impact in his debut season is Manuel Lanzini. The Argentinian midfielder is on loan from the UAE club Al-Jazira and Bilic confirmed his move will be made permanent. “I don’t know whether the agreement is for April or May but the deal will be done,” he said.

Louis van Gaal may buy striker to sharpen blunt Manchester United
~~AUTHOR~~

~CONTENTS~
Louis van Gaal may seek to solve Manchester United’s goalscoring problems by buying a new striker in the transfer window. United have just 25 goals in their last 25 games and Van Gaal is conscious that this is not good enough. The manager believes a change of luck will help but is also willing to spend to try to turn United’s season around.The Dutchman has overseen seven goalless draws this season, six of which have been at Old Trafford. Swansea City are the visitors on Saturday and as United are nine points behind Arsenal and Leicester City they have to start winning games if their faltering title challenge is to be reignited.Manchester United cut short Will Keane’s loan at Preston to bolster attack Read moreLast month United failed to claim a single victory and were knocked out of the Champions League. It was the poorest December in the club’s 138-year history and, as things stand, Wayne Rooney and Anthony Martial are United’s joint top scorers in all competitions with seven each.“It [a lack of goals] can be solved with money but also on the training pitch,” said Van Gaal, who on Friday recalled the 22-year-old striker Will Keane from a loan spell at Preston to bolster his attacking options. “Scoring goals is a quality. We have that quality but at this moment there is a lack of confidence at the right time or we need to buy another striker. It is always like that.Alan Curtis tells Swansea to be bold against Manchester United Read more“That is our problem [scoring]. When you analyse the matches we are always capable of playing in our style. Only Arsenal, and maybe the first half against Stoke and Palace, we didn’t play in that style.” United lost the first two of those games without scoring and drew the last 0-0. “All the rest, we had that style, we created chances and were the dominating team. But we didn’t score.“We need also the luck of a striker. There are several players who played in the striker’s position. They need luck. How many players have had the chances to score and why they didn’t score? You cannot always explain that.“Of course, we are looking always for solutions in the team. Also for this moment, but we still have a good team and we can still score goals. I am convinced of that. But we also need a little luck.”In the summer Van Gaal sold Javier Hernández to Bayer Leverkusen and Robin van Persie to Fenerbahce and allowed Radamel Falcao to leave following a one-year loan, and has since approved James Wilson’s loan to Brighton & Hove Albion.“We could have kept all the strikers but then there would have been a lot of strikers in the tribune [stands],” said the manager. “They are not happy then. They want to go away. It is the story of Hernández, for example. He wants to play. There are now players in my selection who want to play. They cannot play because I choose another player. It is always like that. But too many strikers of high quality for the same position is too much pressure.”United have lost all three of Van Gaal’s matches with Swansea. “It is more or less the same test [as Chelsea]. The pressure that I have seen by myself is still the same,” he said. “We cannot allow the gap to grow. We have to be there at the top of the league. That is our aim. We said that at the beginning of this season. The players are feeling like that also. They want to win because we didn’t win several matches in a row.”Phil Jones has echoed this view. The central defender believes if United can string a sequence of victories together the club will be back in the title race. “It’s strange but the table shows that literally anyone can win the league this season,” he said. “Arsenal, Chelsea, Leicester, City, ourselves, Tottenham, Stoke, Watford – nobody seems to want to win it. It only takes a good run of five, six, seven games and getting a few wins and it soon turns around. We’re disappointed with the way we’ve played over the past few games, although we did well against Chelsea, but by no means are we out of it [the title race]. If we can put a few wins together we’ll be right back up there.”On a positive note for United, they have kept more clean sheets than any other team in the Premier League this season – 10 from 19 outings. “I was always taught as a youngster that if you keep a clean sheet you’ve got a great chance of winning the game, and we’ve done that more often than not this season,” Jones said. “Norwich and Stoke were games in which we conceded sloppy goals, but other than those matches we’ve been pretty solid. Everyone who’s played has done their job and we hope we can carry that on and produce more clean sheets.”Van Gaal was unmoved regarding whether Ryan Giggs, his No2, is exerting greater influence on team matters. “Nothing has changed. You can create something but nothing has changed,” the 64-year-old said. The Dutchman also gave an update on Luke Shaw, who is recovering from a broken leg. “He is more or less having a short vacation,” said Van Gaal. “He is away for a week. He is coming back on 1 January to continue with his recuperation. He is doing well but now I cannot be specific because he has been away for a week.““Everything is going well until now. But I cannot say whether he will be back this season.”

Steve McClaren remains positive but insists Newcastle buy a striker
~~AUTHOR~~
Louise Taylor
~CONTENTS~
Steve McClaren has made it clear that the brave public face seen by Newcastle United supporters is at odds with the inner turmoil engendered by a job which ultimately ground even Alan Pardew down.A year after a disillusioned, uncharacteristically cowed Pardew defected to Crystal Palace, Newcastle are third bottom of the Premier League and McClaren is fighting to not only keep his job but convince Mike Ashley, the club’s owner, of the need to modify recruitment policy.Last week the former England coach, who has remained commendably calm and measured since succeeding John Carver last summer, sat in front of television cameras and issued a relentlessly positive message regarding his team’s prospects at Arsenal on Saturday. Shortly afterwards, McClaren moved to a changing room a few yards down a training ground corridor for a more informal chat with newspaper reporters and, finally, the mask slipped a little.Steve McClaren tells his Newcastle players to get physical with Arsenal Read more“I’ve been here [in a relegation fight] before, I never liked it and I still don’t like it,” said the 54-year-old. “It frustrates, annoys, angers, disappoints. But it’s no good doing nothing about it. We’re working hard to change things; we’re keeping plugging away. We’re going to stick it out and fight.”If McClaren cannot be entirely confident of persuading Ashley and his lieutenants to break their rules on signing players aged over 26 in order to introduce some much needed experience and leadership, he has at least identified a tactical survival strategy.Once it became clear Newcastle lacked the calibre of midfielder required to fulfil his initial possession-based blueprint he reverted to Pardew’s old counterattacking game. He hopes this will be a temporary measure but trusts it can help transform Newcastle’s season. “It’s only half-time,” he said, turning optimistic again. “I’ve had many a nightmare first half of a season but then the second half’s been terrific and a big turnaround. That’s the kind of thing we need – and expect.“We always said it would be difficult. The evidence said work needed doing here. I think everyone knew that at the beginning and certainly everyone knows it now. All I can say is we’re prepared to do the work and I never become a pessimist.”Even so, McClaren acknowledges that adverse results have, at times, sapped morale. “Sapping is a good word,” he said. “That’s what we’ve got to try and get away from, we’ve got to keep the mentality strong, keep taking the positives.”After the disappointing collection of a solitary point from festive fixtures against Aston Villa, Everton and West Brom, it has not been lost on Newcastle’s hierarchy that he endured sticky starts to his tenures at both Middlesbrough and FC Twente, the clubs where he enjoyed the most success. For his part, McClaren is adamant that Newcastle is not quite as dysfunctional as it often appears.“There’s some really good people behind the scenes here,” he said. “They’re different to some people at other places who can’t see the light at the end of the tunnel. The people here really want to make a success of this. There’s a lot of hard work going on behind the scenes which isn’t necessarily showing but, hopefully, in the second half of the season it will.”Last month Pardew revealed that he was “beaten down” by both Newcastle’s internal politics and the “emotion” surrounding the club, but McClaren has not yet reached that point. Instead he has cautioned that relegation will loom should the board fail to sign a forward this month. “At the moment Aleksandar Mitrovic is our only fit striker,” he said, pointedly.

Manchester City’s Pellegrini hopes Kompany injury is not threat to career
~~AUTHOR~~
Jamie Jackson
~CONTENTS~
Manuel Pellegrini is hopeful Vincent Kompany’s chronic calf condition is not career threatening, although the Manchester City manager cannot rule out the defender having to manage the problem until he retires.Kompany sustained a 13th separate calf injury since joining City in August 2008 when he limped off against Sunderland on Boxing Day. The club captain had been on the field nine minutes as a second-half replacement, having just returned from a previous strain to the muscle that occurred during the goalless draw at Aston Villa in early November.The top 10 strikers in the Premier League so far this season Read moreThe 29-year-old may be ruled out until the latter part of this month and there is concern regarding the long-term effect on Kompany’s ability to feature regularly. Asked if the Belgian’s career might be in the balance, Pellegrini said: “We hope not. We hope that this must be a moment of his career. I think that he is a very professional player. He and the club and are going to do all we can to try to help him.”The Chilean could not rule out Kompany having to nurse the injury for the remainder of his career. “It’s difficult for me to answer these questions because I repeat again, I am not a doctor,” he said. “A lot of players at some moments of their career have a bad season for different injuries. I hope this is the part of the season for Kompany and the second part he will be fit. If not, of course, I repeat we must try to do everything we can do to try to know why.”At the halfway point of the season City are third with 36 points, three behind Leicester – with whom they drew on Tuesday – and the leaders, Arsenal. Despite Kompany’s importance, Pellegrini feels sure his side can win the title should he be absent for the majority of the second half of this campaign. “We are going to win the title if we don’t depend on just one player,” he said. “It doesn’t matter who it is. You don’t want to depend on just one player because you have a good squad. Everyone must demonstrate their performance in every game and more important than just one name is to have a performance as a team, which I think we had against Leicester in the last game.“If we add those important individual performances I am sure we are going to be involved in the fight for the title.”City travel to Watford for Saturday’s late kick-off without an away league win since 12 September – 1-0 at Crystal Palace – and collecting only three points from six subsequent matches on the road.“I don’t think it’s psychological. You have to see every game why we didn’t win,” Pellegrini said. “Against Tottenham we played very well in the first half,” he said of the 4-1 defeat. “We conceded two goals which were offside but it wasn’t a bad performance, although the result wasn’t what we wanted. Against Stoke [a 2-0 defeat] we played very bad, so you can’t win if you don’t play very well.”Examining a trio of goalless draws, he said: “Against Aston Villa I think we were very unlucky not to win, against Manchester United was a very close game as normal and was a good draw, and the last game against Leicester I don’t think we played badly.“So if you tell me how happy I am with the results of the six games – no. But if you ask me how happy I am about the performances – [apart from] Stoke, the complete game, and the second half of Tottenham, I think the other games we didn’t do bad.”Pellegrini does believe, however, that City’s away form will have to improve if the title is to be secured. “You don’t know but of course we must improve,” he said. “We cannot continue not winning away but in the other sense we are the strongest team at home. In the second round of games at home we play all the teams that are near our position, against Arsenal, against Leicester, Crystal Palace, Manchester United, Tottenham, we need to play at home.“It’s very important to try and be a consistent team away and at home and to add more points than the other teams.”Sergio Agüero may play for 90 minutes against Watford, having returned from a heel injury but not completing his subsequent two appearances, against Arsenal and Leicester. “I hope he scores two or three goals,” Pellegrini said.

Sam Allardyce warns Sunderland not to rely on another miracle escape
~~AUTHOR~~
Louise Taylor
~CONTENTS~
Sam Allardyce has never really gone in for euphemisms but since taking charge at Sunderland his language is becoming plainer by the week.“Shite,” was the manager’s blunt, one-word answer to an inquiry about the way December had unfolded for a side that have now lost their last five games, conceding 12 goals in the process. Some rather more colourful expletives can be expected should Sunderland stumble again when Aston Villa visit the Stadium of Light on Saturday.“It’s the biggest game of the season, so we mustn’t fail miserably again,” says Allardyce. “The last time we faced a big game [the 1-0 home defeat against Watford] we failed miserably, so we must hold our nerve against Villa. We have to make sure we win.”Rémi Garde says his Aston Villa players need to believe in themselves Read moreThe consensus is that Rémi Garde has virtually no hope of keeping bottom-placed Villa in the Premier League, but 19th-placed Sunderland have only four more points and look in danger of becoming cut off from the rest of the table.“We’ve got to become proactive,” says Allardyce who, shocked by certain players’ haziness about basic defensive positioning, has resorted to some “boringly” repetitious training sessions. “Villa will probably sit in and play on the counterattack. They’ll try and frustrate us, so we’ve got to make sure we take control of the game and break them down. We have 12 points and I think we’ll need 38 to stay up. It’s all about holding your nerve.”Michael Gray, a former Sunderland left-back, has branded his old side “mid-table Championship” calibre, but Allardyce is adamant the survival quest is not a forlorn cause. “I wouldn’t be here if I didn’t think I could keep us up,” insists Dick Advocaat’s successor.“If that was the case I might as well pack my bags now. But we have to be more consistent. I see some very good performances and then I see some very poor ones from the same players. That’s got to be cut out – and quickly.”Liverpool’s Jürgen Klopp laughs off Sam Allardyce’s ‘soft German jibe’ Read moreSunderland’s manager talks, rather wistfully, about wanting his team “to be more like Watford”, but it is only just over four years since Martin O’Neill succeeded Steve Bruce on Wearside and immediately revealed a very different template. “I want to see us playing like Barcelona,” he told supporters.Back then many season ticket-holders still bought into the former chairman Niall Quinn’s talk of embarking on “a magic carpet ride”, but a subsequent series of relegation skirmishes under O’Neill, Paolo Di Canio, Gus Poyet and Advocaat has left locals grateful for small mercies.Along the way a director of football system was introduced and then scrapped by Ellis Short, the owner. But player recruitment remained almost uniformly poor. Other constants include frequent defeats against almost anyone except Newcastle – Sunderland have beaten their local rivals six times in succession – and the extraordinary loyalty of a crowd averaging well over 40,000.That startling run of success against Newcastle is suggestive of a team which can rouse itself when it matters – a suspicion borne out by the conclusions of the past two seasons. Once Advocaat replaced Poyet last spring Sunderland survived thanks to three wins and three draws in their final nine games, while a year earlier they managed four victories and a draw in their closing six fixtures.Considering that run featured wins at Chelsea and Manchester United, Poyet dubbed their great escape “a miracle”. He did not exaggerate; two years ago Sunderland became only the second team to escape relegation from the Premier League after being bottom on Christmas Day.By new year 2014, though, they had collected 14 points, two more than Allardyce’s team now. “We’ve got to start winning – and quickly,” says a man who, having experimented with five at the back and variations of 4-3-3, is tempted to switch to a 4-4-2 configuration which would enable him to pair Jermain Defoe with Steven Fletcher in attack. “I’ve told the players they can’t depend on another last-minute escape; there’s unlikely to be another miracle.”It does not help that Lee Cattermole is struggling with the after-effects of a back problem. The combative, influential midfielder has started every game in which Sunderland have accrued points this season but by the second half of Wednesday’s 1-0 home defeat against Liverpool he seemed barely able to jog.With a trip to Swansea and a visit from Bournemouth beckoning, January could prove a watershed month for the top tier’s eighth-best remunerated squad, but Allardyce’s hopes of introducing new faces are hampered by Short’s understandable insistence that new signings agree contracts containing clauses triggering 50% wage reductions in the event of relegation.More immediately, assorted injuries dictate that Sunderland must once again rely on the 36-year-old, increasingly creaky-kneed Wes Brown at centre-half. “I treat every game now as if it’s my last, so I’m more than up for Villa,” says the former England defender. “It’s a game we can’t lose. We’re way off safety but beating Villa would be a big step forward.”

Mesut Özil has Arsenal daring to dream of Premier League glory
~~AUTHOR~~
David Hytner
~CONTENTS~
Eye contact. According to Theo Walcott, it is all that Mesut Özil needs. Once the Arsenal playmaker has locked on, the creative sparks fly. It is the speed of Özil’s execution that has taken the breath away. “You think: ‘Give the ball now,’” Arsène Wenger has said. “You have not finished your thinking and the ball has gone already.”Arsenal are riding high at the turn of the Premier League season and Walcott believes that in his 10 years at the club, this is the best team he has played for. It is Özil who has ignited the possibilities.In April 2014, towards the end of Özil’s first season at Arsenal – which had been marked by highs and lows – Wenger predicted the German would be a contender for the player of the year awards in 2014‑15. It is worth remembering the line the manager used to support his argument. “The improvement will be in goals, assists and his presence in the game,” he said. It was only Wenger’s timing that was out.Arsenal could be blown all the way to league glory by trademark second wind | Amy Lawrence Read more“Without a doubt, Mesut has been the player of this season so far,” Walcott said. “The stats show that but it’s more than that. It’s his work rate through the games. He is only going to get better and better. You don’t have many left-footers and they make that movement from out to in, they make the bend of the ball. You just have to make eye contact with Mesut and, once you get that, he knows where you’re going to go.”Özil has 16 assists in the Premier League and three goals; he has two more goals in the Champions League. On Monday, he took Bournemouth apart in the 2-0 win at the Emirates Stadium, setting up the first for Gabriel and scoring the second himself. Özil laid on a total of nine chances, the majority of them for Walcott.“Mesut has told me to keep making runs,” Walcott said. “He just spots it. I need to help him out by putting the ball in the net. Mesut is just a special player and he is in the form of his life. Some of the things you see on the pitch … his goal against Bournemouth alone. He didn’t break stride, it was like he was jogging. He just slows things down when he is playing.”Newcastle United visit the Emirates on Saturday and could be forgiven for feeling afraid. For Arsenal, the fear is that Özil will break down. Wenger gave him a week off during the last international break and he said that, of late, Özil “doesn’t practise a lot, we rest him a lot between games.”Red zones have become the buzz phrase around Arsenal’s finely-tuned stars and, when available, Wenger always plays Özil. He dare not leave him out, particularly while Santi Cazorla and Jack Wilshere are injured.“You look, as well, at the impact Özil can have on other players,” Wenger said. “The Premier League is very tight and if you go into a decisive game and you do that [rest Özil], the other players think subconsciously: ‘Why?’ They don’t tell you but they think: ‘Why?’ Even the player himself does.”Wenger advanced one of those theories of his that is designed to soothe anxiety but does not always bear scrutiny. “Özil is a guy who, once the basic fitness is there between the games, he wants to play,” Wenger said. “There are types of players and sometimes the most technical players … it looks like it demands less energy for them to play. It is just natural for them.”Özil made a slow start to last season after his World Cup triumph with Germany and he was ruled out for three months from early October with a knee problem. But when he came back, he eased into fine form and Arsenal finished the season strongly.Özil has not looked back since. His relationships with team-mates such as Walcott are now established and there is the hope that the club can once again enjoy a powerful second half to the season, boosted by the return of injured players. If they do, a first title in 12 years could be their reward.“We don’t want to look ahead of ourselves but we have a history of ending the season well,” Walcott said. “We are getting players back fit and we have one of the best squads when we have everyone fit. I truly believe that. It’s the best team I’ve been involved in and when you have Mesut and the way he is playing, it gets the best out of everyone.“Players came in against Bournemouth who hadn’t been playing too much and they did fantastically well and that just shows the strength in depth we have in this team, and the pressure on places. We have the confidence and it’s just flowing out there.”Walcott also talked about Arsenal’s last-16 Champions League draw with Barcelona – the team who eliminated them in 2010 and 2011, and beat them in the 2006 final. “I’d actually totally forgotten when it was the draw,” he said. “We have a group message and the guys were saying: ‘You won’t believe who we’ve got.’ Obviously Barcelona’s three up front are their main threat and it will be a tough draw but we have good qualities in this team and we can do some damage.“It will be special and when we play them away [in the second leg], it is my birthday so, hopefully, it’ll be a good moment for me and the team. If you want to reach the best in the game, you’ve got to play the best.”Walcott believes that with Özil, he is alongside the best.

Aitor Karanka and Paul Clement, the former Madrid No2s, share No1 aim
~~AUTHOR~~
Louise Taylor
~CONTENTS~
First time visitors to the Riverside Stadium invariably find their eyes drawn to Temenos. The arresting, 50 metre-tall Anish Kapoor sculpture is situated a long goal-kick from Middlesbrough’s home, and away fans can frequently be heard debating what the enormous web of steel wires slung between two giant hoops positioned beside the Tees actually signifies.Translated from its original Greek, Temenos means a piece of sacred land assigned as a place of sanctuary or the holy area surrounding a temple. After a year that has seen the decimation of Teesside’s steel industry the installation’s immediate environs have certainly proved a welcome oasis amid considerable local gloom.The Riverside will be packed to capacity on Saturday when the Championship leaders take on second-placed Derby County with the contest further spiced by a managerial sub-plot dubbed the battle of the former Real Madrid No2s. Boro’s Aitor Karanka assisted José Mourinho at the Bernabéu while Derby’s Paul Clement served as Carlo Ancelotti’s sidekick.“I think there’s some big similarities between us,” acknowledges Karanka. “To work with Carlo or José is like working with a master. When you’re with coaches like that you’re always at big clubs and always under pressure. You learn a lot. But after that, you have to put your own signature on things. When you become a manager you have to take the decisions and put into practise what you’ve learned.”It is evident that Boro’s manager, a former Real Madrid centre-half who was capped once by Spain, absorbed quite a bit about defensive organisation from Mourinho. With Dani Ayala in imperious central defensive form, Karanka’s backline is the meanest in the Championship and has now gone seven league games without conceding a goal. Indeed only two goals have been registered against Boro at the Riverside all season.Karanka is big on performing meticulous due diligence on the characters of all new recruits and this policy has helped forge an extraordinary dressing room spirit. When, back in October, the team had a mini wobble, Grant Leadbitter, Boro’s captain, reacted to a defeat at Cardiff by holding a spontaneous squad gathering at his house. The players talked for hours and, with Stewart Downing shifted into his preferred central attacking position in Karanka’s favoured 4-2-3-1 formation, Boro have won nine of their subsequent 11 Championship matches.An already rare bond between club and community was intensified when the left-back George Friend came up with the idea of players posing topless for a 2016 calendar with all proceeds going to the families of former steelworkers. It has not only been a big hit but reminded everyone of the importance of boosting the local economy and putting the area right back on the map by winning promotion.The latest delays to a decision over a third runway for Heathrow have meant the longed for, economically vital resumption of flights from Durham Tees Valley airport to London remains on hold but a return to the Premier League would, at least, make Middlesbrough part of the national, and international, conversation again.Karanka’s problem is that his is not the only club desperate to plug into a network powered by the gargantuan riches provided by next season’s top-tier television deal. If he and Clement will be deemed failures should their teams miss out on promotion, Chris Hughton is on a mission to make Brighton part of the south coast’s elite, while Steve Bruce’s Hull and Sean Dyche’s Burnley are similarly anxious to scramble back into the Premier League. Everyone is striving to create a Temenos, their very own place of sanctuary, in the game’s promised land.Ipswich, too, are in contention but their manager believes Karanka and Clement will celebrate automatic promotion in May. “If anyone finishes above Middlesbrough or Derby I’ll be very surprised,” says Mick McCarthy. “It’s not realistic for us to catch either of those two – although we’ll be trying like hell.”Karanka, whose side are a point ahead of Derby with a game in hand, seems in cautious agreement. “I think the league will be clearer this season than it was last year,” he says. “Even so, a lot of things can still happen and we have to concentrate on maintaining our momentum. I’ve only been in England two years but I know that every single game in this division is tough. I know we could beat Derby but then easily go somewhere like Bolton and lose.”The plight of Neil Lennon’s bottom-placed Bolton – a recent, established top-flight team who are now struggling to meet their wage bill – serves as a salutary warning of what can go wrong when clubs spend beyond their means in high-stakes promotion gambles.Karanka is suitably desperate to insulate Boro’s financial future with television riches. “The only thing I care about is Middlesbrough being in the Premier League next season,” he says. “It would be difficult for me to find a better chairman than Steve Gibson and I feel attached to this club, to this crowd and to the people who live here. My family are enjoying it a lot, we’re really comfortable here. I feel I’m in the right place, with the right people, at the right moment.”

Mauricio Pochettino says next 10 games could make or break Tottenham
~~AUTHOR~~
Jacob Steinberg
~CONTENTS~
Mauricio Pochettino has said he will allow himself to think about the possibility of Tottenham Hotspur winning the Premier League title only if his team’s impressive form continues in their next 10 matches.Tottenham are four points off first place after their late win at Watford on Monday and they visit Everton on Sunday seeking their fourth consecutive victory but Pochettino is not getting carried away. “We need to arrive in the last 10 games with the possibility to fight for the objectives,” the manager said. “The next nine, 10 games will maybe make the mark on how we finish in the table.”Pochettino, who has indicated he will make signings this month only if they do not disrupt the balance of his squad, believes the maturity of his young side’s behaviour is a sign they will be able to handle the pressure of challenging for the title. Spurs are fourth and have lost only twice.Tottenham can win the Premier League, says Everton’s Roberto Martínez Read more“I think we are very quiet,” Pochettino said. “The good thing is we don’t speak too much but we work very hard and I think it is most important how we behave inside, so that we can speak outside. Because football is about winning games, and to win games and to be close to winning games, you need to work hard and to show better quality than the opponent.“We are very quiet. We believe in ourselves. We are very confident and in football a lot can happen. We believe. The only way we cannot achieve all that we can in football is if we stop working hard.”Pochettino admitted the challenge for him and his coaching staff is to ensure they do not stand still. “I think this always is our challenge, to try to improve every day because if you stop improving you start to go backwards,” he said. “And I think that we always, in our minds, try to improve every day.“How? This is a good question, it’s our quality and our creativity, and this is because we work every day. It’s our motivation every day to try to improve and develop new ideas. We need to create every day and try to improve ourselves to teach the players.”Tottenham’s hopes of beating Everton will largely depend on how they cope with Romelu Lukaku, who has scored 11 goals in his past 10 matches. However the Belgian striker will not find it easy against two of his international team-mates.Jan Vertonghen and Toby Alderweireld have formed an outstanding partnership in central defence since the latter’s arrival from Atlético Madrid last summer and Tottenham have the best defensive record in the Premier League, with 15 goals conceded from 19 matches.“It is obvious after 19 games that Alderweireld is one of the best defenders in the Premier League,” Pochettino said. “I think it is easy to analyse him now. He has given us very good performance and maturity and experience. He is a great boy, a great man.”Vertonghen’s form has improved alongside his fellow Belgian centre-back. “They are good partners,” Pochettino said. “For me, it is important how we work as a team, to try and defend our goal, and to have a very good balance. But it is true that Toby has made a very good impact in the team.”

Jürgen Klopp: ‘I don’t want to bring Daniel Sturridge back too soon’
~~AUTHOR~~
Paul Wilson
~CONTENTS~
Daniel Sturridge will not be making his latest injury comeback at Upton Park on Saturday afternoon despite hints from Jürgen Klopp that he might be ready to play against West Ham. The Liverpool striker declared himself fit after a hamstring strain a few days ago but has stayed on Merseyside along with Jordan Henderson, who has a foot injury.Liverpool begin a tough January programme with Saturday’s visit to the capital but Klopp says he is merely exercising caution with Sturridge, not keeping him in reserve for the Capital One Cup semi-final or the forthcoming games against Arsenal and Manchester United.Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekend Read moreMindful of Sturridge’s injury record, – Sturridge has only managed six games this season – Klopp wants to make doubly sure of his readiness before reintroducing him. “I am not holding Daniel back, I am trying to get him fit,” Klopp explained. “He has trained intensively and seems OK but now we must see how he reacts. I want to have him in the best shape, that is all. The best thing would be another two weeks but earlier might be possible. The main thing is not to bring him back too soon and have him pick up another injury. We just have to be patient.”Sturridge has missed most of the season through three separate injuries to hip, knee and hamstring,and after starting and scoring twice against Southampton in the Capital One Cup, he has played only once since – the 2-0 defeat at Newcastle in early December. Liverpool also lost Divock Origi to a hamstring injury against Leicester on Boxing Day, though Christian Benteke is available again and has provided the winning goal in each of the last two games.Klopp’s targets for the second half of the season are to win more points than in the first half and go as far as possible in all the cups. “January could be a crucial month but it is difficult to talk about even the middle of January because we need to be focused on the start,” the German said. “We have West Ham, then Stoke, then Exeter, then Arsenal. In just the first week of the month we are in three different competitions. It’s match by match, with hardly any time to recover and prepare, and it is going to be a particularly demanding time for the teams in the Capital One Cup semi-finals.”Liverpool are still in the Europa League too, which recommences in February. “It is intensive but that is because we have been successful,” Klopp said. “We will play at least four games more than the others, because of the Capital One and the Europa League, and we are starting to see the effect in the dressing room. After our last win the players were not celebrating; they were sitting still, thinking about the next game. I can see why people say January will be decisive.”A year ago Klopp was still in charge of Borussia Dortmund, where he has become the club’s longest-serving manager. He is clearly still getting used to English football, but looks back on 2015 as a good year. “I had the longest holiday in my life and the biggest change in my life, changing country. It has been a good year for me personally.”

A-League referee Williams apologises for gaffes in Wanderers stalemate
~CONTENTS~
A-League referee Ben Williams made a televised apology for making a mistake in two of three contentious first-half decisions that overshadowed Western Sydney’s goalless stalemate with Adelaide United. Williams stole the spotlight for all the wrong reasons at Pirtek Stadium on Friday night, leaving both sides feeling aggrieved over a disallowed goal and two clear penalty appeals.How can Football Federation Australia improve after dismal showing in 2015? | Joe Gorman Read moreUnited continued their mini-revival, and will be happy to have held the Wanderers scoreless for the first time since the Sydney derby more than two months ago. The engaging, end-to-end affair brought the home side’s unbeaten streak to 10 games, but Brisbane Roar could overtake Tony Popovic’s men by the end of Saturday.But for all the attacking football, the focus was again on controversy. First, Wanderers striker Federico Piovaccari was disallowed an opening goal after a shoulder-to-shoulder tussle with Dylan McGowan. The pair had each other by the shirts as they hurtled downfield but the stocky Italian was stronger, driving the ball past United custodian Eugene Galekovic, who didn’t even bother to dive.If that decision was 50-50, what came moments later was clear-cut. Michael Marrone charged into the box and was fouled by Wanderers captain Nikolai Topor-Stanley, only for Williams to ignore it. Then, right on the tick of halftime, McGowan appeared to bring down Mark Bridge in another appeal gone wanting.After the match, Williams admitted that after watching video replays he realised he’d gotten it wrong on the latter two counts. “Having seen the contact now (from Topor-Stanley on Marrone), I think that’s a penalty. So my apologies there,” he told Fox Sports. “In regards to the other one with the Mark Bridge challenge ... that’s probably a penalty also. Of course, we never like to make errors, but this is the way it goes.”“From my position that’s what I saw on the day.”Adelaide coach Guillermo Amor agreed Marrone should have earned a penalty, while Popovic said it was disappointing Piovaccari did not seal the winner – a decision Williams was not asked about. “The one with Nikolai, you see those given. The one with Bridgey, that was a pen,” he said. “But the one with Nikolai happened just after Piovaccari’s goal was disallowed, so that wouldn’t have happened. I think getting that first one wrong was a shame, because they were both pulling each other.”The Wanderers pressed hard and looked like they would score right up until the final whistle, in a dominant second half when Adelaide finally ran out of puff. Bruce Djite had the earliest shot at opening the scoring, however Wanderers gloveman Andrew Redmayne was quick to stop it, as he did in a fine reflex move late on to deny Craig Goodwin at the near post.Sergio Cirio came even closer to joy with a lovely strike off a Djite cross that hit the woodwork. Western Sydney too had their chances. Classy United custodian and skipper Eugene Galekovic reached high to tip an audacious chip from Andreu over the crossbar, then dived left to stop Castelen’s on-target belter.Piovaccari was short on luck all night, including when his solid header was unwittingly deflected by an offside Bridge before it reached its destination at the goal’s bottom corner.

Hull gifted late win against QPR as Diomandé makes most of mix-up
~CONTENTS~
The Queens Park Rangers manager, Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink, insists the club should not even think about winning promotion after their 2-1 defeat at home to Hull. Adama Diomandé’s injury-time winner for the visitors left Rangers 15th in the table and still without a win since Hasselbaink took over as manager at Loftus Road.The Dutchman was appointed following the sacking of Chris Ramsey, who lost his job because the club’s owners expected a promotion challenge. However, Hasselbaink, who has been in charge for six matches, said: “I’m not even thinking of that. We shouldn’t even be thinking about promotion.“We should just be thinking about improving the team. Everybody is thinking about the outcome, but we need to get other things right first.“Of course it’s frustrating, but believe it or not that [getting the first win] is not the focus. If you are going to focus on win, win, win, you are not going to get the game right, and you have to get the game right to win. I think today we got it right.”QPR seemed to have rescued a point when Sebastian Polter headed in an 86th-minute equaliser to cancel out Abel Hernández’s opener. However, when defender Grant Hall and goalkeeper Rob Green collided as they attempted to clear Sam Clucas’s cross, the ball struck Diomandé and rebounded into the net.“It looked like we were going to get the three points after we scored. There was only one team in it at that moment,” Hasselbaink said. “I think we were unfortunate to lose that game. It was not a game where they hammered us or we hammered them. It was actually a draw in a way.”Hull are third in the table and their manager, Steve Bruce, believes keeping his best players during this month’s transfer window is crucial to their promotion chances.“It’s still too early to say, but we’ve got a chance [of promotion],” said Bruce. “We’ve brought in some younger players who have done well, so we have got a good mix. The important thing now is to keep hold of what we’ve got. That’s going to be the key.”The result was the perfect birthday present for the Hull manager, who turned 55 on Thursday, and a major boost after three consecutive away defeats.He said: “After the last three away games you could see we were a bit nervous and edgy and needed a result to set us on our way again, and we got that. In the last three away games we haven’t got anywhere near the level required, but now we have got this result.”

Is Roland Duchâtelet leading Charlton into the valley of no return?
~~AUTHOR~~
Nick Miller
~CONTENTS~
Roland Duchâtelet is no stranger to protests. In 2013 a group of Standard Liège fans staged assorted demonstrations and tried to make merry in his offices, in objection to the way he was running their club, and on that occasion they seemed to catch his attention. “I’m not perfect,” he said in response, “but now we understand each other better and that’s why we have signed a charter that stipulates that fans will have a say in issues that closely affect them such as facilities and ticket prices.”Supporters of Charlton will hope he is similarly amenable to the voice of the people this weekend, when a protest is planned against their owner at the game against Nottingham Forest. That the Addicks are next to bottom of the Championship and have not won a game in six weeks is only half the point. The fans who plan to demonstrate are watching their club crumble before their very eyes and the man they blame is Duchâtelet.Charlton fans to protest against Roland Duchâtelet at Nottingham Forest game Read moreIt is easy to see why they think that way, too. In October the manager Guy Luzon, a Tiggerish presence on the touchline but a limited coach, was dismissed; not an unreasonable call on the face of things, as they were in the bottom three having lost seven of their previous nine. But 10 weeks and 11 games later a permanent replacement has still not been appointed. Luzon followed club hero Chris Powell, José Riga and Bob Peeters as managers sacked by Duchâtelet since he arrived in January 2014, and Karel Fraeye, formerly Riga’s assistant but whose previous managerial experience extended to the Belgian third division, has been the interim head coach for over two months.As well as having no permanent manager, they have no chief scout and no director of football, leading one to wonder who is signing players and feeding into a recruitment strategy that could at best be described as curious. This summer the defender Zakarya Bergdich was signed with a degree of fanfare from Real Valladolid but has played only 27 minutes under Fraeye and may move on in January. Most bafflingly, the mercurial Tony Watt, a sometimes inconsistent but often threatening attacker, was loaned to Cardiff in November and will probably also be sold now the transfer window is open.Duchâtelet, in the early days of his tenure, tried to fill the squad with players from his network of clubs, of which Liège was one but also included teams in Hungary, Spain and Germany. The trouble was that many of these players were, not to put too fine a point on it, awful, which has meant they have been over-reliant on a collection of promising but raw youth team graduates.However, these youngsters will not be around for long. Recently the chief executive, Katrien Meire, stated that the club’s business model was based on developing these young players and selling them on, with Diego Poyet and Joe Gomez already flogged to the Premier League as part of that approach. This is not the most revolutionary way of surviving in the Football League, but the way Charlton are going about it seems flawed. The general mismanagement of the rest of the squad means these youngsters are often thrown in before they are ready, thus stunting their development and decreasing their appeal and value for bigger and more monied clubs. The 18-year-old Karlan Ahearne-Grant, who started the season well but has since faded, is a case in point.Equally, it is hardly an approach to get fans particularly excited and Meire’s admission was part of an interesting approach to PR. She recently called some unhappy Charlton fans “weird” for thinking they had a “sense of ownership” of the club, sniggered at their protests and compared them with patrons of a cinema – probably not the wisest move.There is also a significant whiff of shambles to the way the club is run. Some season tickets were not posted out until the day before the first game of the season, while it was recently announced the ticket office itself would be closed on Wednesdays and Thursdays, for reasons unclear. To add to the sense that clown music could well be the prevailing soundtrack in SE7, the Voice of the Valley fanzine recently reported that an NHS call centre is now being housed in the ticket office. Other wheezes have included a surreal caper which offered fans a chance to watch games from a sofa at the side of the touchline, and a supposed CCTV clip of a couple having sex on the halfway line, which turned out to be a publicity stunt for their pitch hire scheme.What is particularly frustrating for their fans is that there is hope on the horizon in the shape of the former chief executive Peter Varney. “Back in August I was in a position to introduce an investor to Charlton with a deal that would, I believe, have been good for the current owner and good for the club,” wrote Varney in the latest edition of Voice of the Valley. “The owner will one day come to realise how his asset is being depreciated day-by-day. With a £7m reduction in income staring him in the face should relegation happen, he will need to have a good business plan going forward. Hopefully, there are three weaker teams in the division this season.”However, both Duchâtelet and Meire have ignored his overtures, cancelling three meetings over the last few months (details of which can be seen in Varney’s emails) and showing little inclination either to sell or to accept any real investment. While there is a danger of an “anyone but Duchâtelet” atmosphere taking over and the fans backing any alternative, it is vexing that they will not even entertain Varney’s overtures.With a substandard set of players, a tactically naive temporary coach with no sign of a permanent one being appointed, shambolic organisation and an owner who does not seem keen on accepting help, it is no surprise that the Charlton fans are taking action. If things do not change, Charlton are doomed to relegation, the fear being that they will not return any time soon.The hope is that Duchâtelet will pay attention to the protests before it is too late. The fear is that, since he has not watched a game at The Valley in over a year and seems to display naked contempt for the club’s support, he will simply ignore them.

Brighton’s Connor Goldson gives Wolves deflected glory
~CONTENTS~
The Brighton manager Chris Hughton admitted that individual mistakes are proving costly after a first-half own goal by Connor Goldson gifted Wolves a 1-0 victory at the Amex Stadium on Friday.Wolves clinched their third consecutive win when Goldson steered a cross from Jordan Graham into his own net in the 32nd minute.The Seagulls also lost last Tuesday’s home game 1-0 when an error by Lewis Dunk allowed Ipswich’s Daryl Murphy to score the only goal.Hughton is concerned that his players have now not scored in six hours and 35 minutes, and are without a win in six games.“We need to find a way to get goals,” he said. “Defensive errors have given teams a head start in the last two games and they’ve gone on to protect a lead. At the minute things are not going our way, whereas earlier in the season it was.“We must keep motivated, remember how well the players have done and go again. We’re unbeaten away from home and are pleased we have a gap until our next two league games which are both away.”Hughton praised the display of the striker James Wilson, who has been recently been troubled by illness and vomited on the pitch before the game.The Manchester United loanee returned to the starting lineup and Hughton said: “James was the most likely to get a goal with the type of game it was.“He hasn’t been well with a cold and it is a combination of that and the volume of games that he’s been involved in. He’s come from being a squad player at Manchester United.”The Wolves manager Kenny Jackett believes his players have been rewarded for hard work to boast nine points out of nine and three clean sheets.The former Swansea and Millwall manager said: “The players played with a lot of character and this was necessary to negate a very good Brighton side.”Looking ahead to the January transfer window, Jacket said he would like to give his players “some help” as they look towards making an impression in the top half of the table.“We don’t need too many players out as this will give us problems,” he said. “We did well to cope with Brighton; they are a good side and deserve to be where they are.“The top five deserve to be there – they are there for a reason. Ipswich are coming through very strongly but the top five will take some shifting.”Jackett said he will assess the position of Rajiv van La Parra next week now that the winger’s loan period at Brighton has finished. The Dutchman was ineligible to face his parent club at the Amex Stadium. “He’s done very well, his confidence is high and he’s taken his opportunity very well,” Jackett said. “But he is a Wolves player, he’ll be with us next week and we’ll assess him.”Brighton 0-1 Wolves: Championship – as it happened Read more

Bournemouth confirm loan signing of Juan Iturbe from Roma

Guardian sport
~CONTENTS~
Bournemouth have confirmed the signing of the Roma winger Juan Iturbe on loan for the rest of the season, with a view to a permanent signing in the summer for an undisclosed fee, believed to be in the region of £11m.The Argentinian, who is still awaiting confirmation of his work permit, had been on the verge of a move to Watford before Eddie Howe’s side swooped for a player who joined the Giallorossi in the summer of 2014.The 22-year-old moved to Roma from Verona for an initial €22m (£16m) – though the deal has been valued at as much as €31m once signing-on and agents’ fees are taken into consideration. He failed to produce his best form at the Stadio Olimpico, scoring three goals in 39 league appearances, with his only goal this season coming against Frosinone in September.“It’s a big opportunity for me to come and play in the Premier League,” he told Cherries Player. “I’d like to thank everyone for making this move happen and I’m very pleased to be here.“There were a few clubs that were interested but things happened pretty quickly and once this process was under way it was a straightforward decision for me to make.“I didn’t know a lot about Bournemouth as a club but the more I read and the more I found out how much they wanted me, it’s an easy decision to go to a place where you feel really wanted. That became the overriding factor.”Iturbe’s career started at the Paraguayan club Cerro Porteño, and he was brought to Europe by Porto in 2011, at the age of 18. After a year and a half in Portugal, in which he did not start a league game, he returned to South America, playing the second half of the 2012-13 season at River Plate before moving to Verona.He is known for his speed and fluent running with the ball, as well as his dangerous left-footed set pieces.“Iturbe met his new team-mates on New Year’s Day and enjoyed his first training session,” Bournemouth announced on their website, where t. They also confirmed he is not be eligible for Saturday’s trip to Leicester.

Charlton fans to protest against Roland Duchâtelet at Nottingham Forest game
~~AUTHOR~~
Nick Miller
~CONTENTS~
A group of Charlton supporters are planning a protest against the club’s owner, Roland Duchâtelet, after their Championship game against Nottingham Forest at the Valley on Saturday.Charlton sit second-bottom, without a win in seven games, and have won just twice in their last 20 fixtures. A permanent replacement for the former manager Guy Luzon, sacked in October after a poor run of form, still has not been appointed, with his former assistant Karel Fraeye in charge on an “interim” basis ever since.Richard Rufus set to leave Charlton after being labelled a fraudster Read moreFans of the south London club are upset with the way Duchâtelet has run Charlton since arriving in January 2014, in which time he has dismissed four managers, including the club hero Chris Powell. Key players have been sold without significant replacements, with the team overly reliant on youngsters brought through from the club’s academy and players from Duchâtelet’s network of clubs across Europe.The fanzine Voice of the Valley – has urged fans to protest at the Forest game in the hope that Duchâtelet will change his approach, or consider either selling the club or accepting outside investment.Duchâtelet and the chief executive, Katrien Meire, who angered fans by mocking their objections to the running of the club recently, have also declined to enter into dialogue with the former chief executive Peter Varney, who has shown an interest in helping the club.“Back in August I was in a position to introduce an investor to Charlton with a deal that would, I believe, have been good for the current owner, and good for the club,” wrote Varney in the latest edition of Voice of the Valley, which was founded in 1988. “Roland Duchâtelet is a wealthy man. He has the ability to fund a progression of the club on and off the pitch, and he has already done some good things at the Valley and the training ground.“It is an inescapable fact, however, that it is the performances on the pitch which define the level and mood of supporters. The owner will one day come to realise how his asset is being depreciated day by day. With a £7m reduction in income staring him in the face should relegation happen, he will need to have a good business plan going forward.”The outlook for Charlton is bleak, as in addition to their lowly league position they are likely to sell some of their better players in January, including the forward Tony Watt, who has been on loan at Cardiff City.

Arsenal could be blown all the way to league glory by trademark second wind
~~AUTHOR~~
Amy Lawrence
~CONTENTS~
As the Premier League reaches its halfway stage with the top four scrunched together covered by four points, it is premature for audacious predictions. Arsène Wenger barely bothered to play the media game when he was quizzed about the various contenders’ prospects before the new year fixtures. After all, since when was football success measured in semi-seasons?Having said that, if the Arsenal manager reflects on the title-winning seasons he has overseen – and even some of the campaigns that came within touching distance – there is a clear trend of strong second-half charges, where a powerful momentum takes over to propel his teams towards the finishing line. In seven out of his first eight full seasons Arsenal embarked on long undefeated sequences, often including strings of consecutive victories. That brought three titles and four runners-up spots.Mohamed Elneny passes Arsenal medical before £7.3m move from Basel Read moreWhether it was all part of the campaign masterplan with training sessions and physical work adjusted to peak at the latter stages, whether it was down to creatine and super-powered vitamin shots or whether the players were simply talented enough to seize the moment, the bottom line was a second-half-of-the-season surge which became a hallmark of the early Wenger years. The challenge for today’s team is to channel something similar in the months ahead.Lee Dixon recalls being astounded by the feeling within the group the first time it happened, en route to the 1997-98 double. “You could feel it coming,” he says. At the turn of the year Arsenal were quite a distance behind the serial champions Manchester United – in sixth place in the table and 12 points off the top. They had suffered a chastening defeat in December, picked off by Blackburn Rovers, which led to an inquest, and the captain, Tony Adams, was granted some time away instead of battling on through pain. Arsenal were nowhere near being contenders then.But the reaction to that Blackburn mishap was extraordinary. Arsenal did not lose a single match in the Premier League or FA Cup until they ended the season five months later with Adams hoisting both trophies. A sequence of 12 straight wins in the league transformed the team’s sense of belief. According to Dixon, it created a sensation that most people in professional sports do not often get to experience.“The way we did it, from being so far behind and going on that run, we almost felt invincible,” he says. “Every game we went out was like a practice match. It didn’t even matter who we were playing. You got into the dressing room and you weren’t even thinking about the opposition. In my experience, although I have won a lot of stuff, those times are so few and far between. To be in a dressing room where you are literally not caring about anything other than being excited because you know you are going to win, if you could bottle that feeling.”He even describes it, at its best, as a kind of “out-of-body experience”. Dixon remembers the feeling when everything clicks to such an extent “you are taken out of the situation and it is as if you are watching yourself perform. I played in games like that, probably two or three out of 900 or 1,000 games. That season in 1998, on that run, we had those special moments.”Arsenal’s 2001-02 season echoed the 1997-98 pattern. A rotten defeat at home to Newcastle in December provoked a long undefeated march and Arsenal finished with 13 straight wins in the league. On to Wenger’s most recent Premier League title, and in 2003-04 there were no defeats at all over 38 games.This habit took a dip when Arsenal found the going most difficult after the move from Highbury to the Emirates Stadium but in the last few seasons they have been able to rely on a late push, a positive run where needed, to ensure their annual top-four finish. It does seem to be a key part of the Wenger make-up.Arsène Wenger at 1,000 games: Lee Dixon on the arrival of elbow pads Read moreOn the other side of that coin, another characteristic of all the Wenger teams is a capacity to lose to absolutely anybody, anywhere, often when it is least expected. The calendar year of 2015 has served Arsenal very well with more points than anyone else, but the promising stretches have been interrupted with the odd excruciating defeat. Embarrassing upsets at home to Monaco, away at Sheffield Wednesday and more recently the 4-0 pasting at Southampton demonstrate how a sudden, angst-filled defeat can ambush them just when things are looking good. Teams who feel they can win the league are able to roll with those punches.What Arsenal have struggled to do in the last few years is piece together strong sequences over the first and second half of the season. Two seasons ago they were top on New Year’s Day but fell away. Last season they were sixth on 1 January then started to gather points with a vengeance.Wenger is only too aware how much relentless effort is required to complete this season’s jigsaw. Maintaining the fitness and form of key players is crucial. The manager has been encouraged with the way squad players who may not make a fully fit first XI have stepped in. But the influence of Petr Cech, Mesut Özil and Alexis Sánchez, who have all been part of league-winning sides elsewhere and whose presence and example makes such a difference, is paramount.

Watford v Manchester City: match preview
~CONTENTS~
Manchester City travel to Vicarage Road looking for their first away victory since Kelechi Iheanacho scored that late winner against Crystal Palace on 12 September. Man City’s goalless draw with Leicester City on Tuesday left them three points off the top and they cannot afford any complacency against Watford, who have taken four points off Chelsea and Liverpool in the past fortnight. With Vincent Kompany absent, Odion Ighalo will fancy his chances. The Watford striker has seven goals in his past six matches.

Tony Pulis will welcome his former side to the Hawthorns safe in the knowledge he has never been on the losing side in this fixture. Saido Berahino is expected to start for the first time since October, as Victor Anichebe and Salomón Rondón are injured and suspended respectively. West Brom will have to contend with an in form Marko Arnautovic, who has been passed fit despite a tight hamstring.

Steve McClaren has told Newcastle to get physical with Arsenal as he attempts to kick-start the club’s season once again.Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekend Read moreThe Magpies have slipped back into the relegation zone after taking just a single point from festive fixtures against Aston Villa, Everton and West Brom and in the circumstances, Saturday’s trip to the Emirates Stadium hardly represents the most inviting start to 2016.Arsenal’s return to prominence has been due in part to the influence of the Germany international Mesut Özil and Newcastle will have to come up with a plan to stop the main creative force at Arsène Wenger’s disposal if they are to prosper in north London.McClaren said: “It is about collective organisation and discipline – and a certain amount of aggression will be required. We have come across many, many good players in every team. Özil is just another one of them which we will have to contend with. But they have others – [Olivier] Giroud is scoring goals left, right and centre, [Theo] Walcott is coming into form, [Aaron] Ramsey is a very good midfield player. Despite what they are missing, they have still got quality.”McClaren has been hugely impressed with the Gunners this season, particularly in the 3-0 win at Olympiakos on 9 December which secured their Champions League passage.He said: “They have had injuries, but are still maintaining their form. It was as near as perfect a performance against Olympiakos as I have seen from a team for many years. What a result and performance under so much pressure.“Favourites for the title? Definitely, at this stage – but it is only half-time.”Few around St James’ Park will need reminding of the Magpies’ trip to the Emirates on 29 December 2012 when they returned on the wrong end of a remarkable 7-3 scoreline with Walcott plundering a hat-trick and Giroud claiming a double.Newcastle’s current fragility is a cause for concern, but McClaren remains confident that when they are at their best, they can give anyone a game. He said: “We know on any given day we can beat anybody in this league. But we also know that on any given day we can lose.”

Greg Dyke salutes England coach Roy Hodgson’s 40 years in management
~CONTENTS~
Greg Dyke has paid a glowing tribute to Roy Hodgson as the England manager reaches the 40th anniversary of his first managerial appointment. Hodgson, who will lead England to the Euro 2016 finals this summer, moved into management when he took charge of the Swedish side Halmstad in 1976.In the 68-year-old’s long and varied career he has overseen 19 teams in eight countries. Internazionale, Liverpool, Fulham and West Bromwich Albion are among the clubs he has managed, while he has also led the Switzerland, Finland and United Arab Emirates national teams, as well as England.Dyke, the Football Association chairman, said: “Roy is a great example to any aspiring coach that being open to new experiences and cultures can really develop you as a person. His CV is quite remarkable and it is hard to think of another coach of his stature that has been prepared to learn and grow the way he has.“According to the record books he started in Sweden in 1976 and here he is about to take England to the European finals in 2016, still inspiring and encouraging young players – good young English players.“What a fantastic achievement – 40 years coaching at the level he has puts him up there with the great English coaches, much revered people like Sir Bobby Robson, Dave Sexton and Don Howe.”Hodgson ended his playing career, spent largely in the English non-league system, to become a manager aged 28. He made an instant impact by winning two titles with Halmstad and two more with Malmo.Other highlights include leading Inter to a Uefa Cup final, Fulham to the final of the Europa League and taking Switzerland to the 1994 World Cup then qualifying for Euro 96, though he took over at Inter before the latter tournament.He has been England manager since 2012 and, although his future beyond this summer is uncertain, Dyke believes he has been a superb ambassador for the country. He said: “I am constantly amazed by supporters’ reaction to Roy if you go to a game with him. He is genuinely liked.“It is fascinating – wherever we travel people from different countries seek out Roy to share an experience they had of watching one of his sides, or talking to him about a player he once would have managed, or a coach that he knew.“He’s probably done more for the FA’s international relations than anyone. We’re very proud that, as England manager, Roy celebrates 40 years of coaching at the highest levels of our game. Long may it continue.”

Tottenham can win the Premier League, says Everton’s Roberto Martínez
~CONTENTS~
Tottenham’s Premier League title credentials have been backed by Everton manager Roberto Martínez.The top 10 strikers in the Premier League so far this season Read moreSpurs begin 2016 in fourth, just four points off leaders and their north London rivals Arsenal, after suffering just one league defeat since an opening-day loss at Manchester United.They appear to have put that surprise home reverse to Newcastle behind them too, winning three successive games since and Martínez sees no reason why they cannot be contending for a maiden Premier League title success come May.Asked whether he believed their opponents this weekend were capable of mounting a serious title challenge, Martínez replied: “Why not? If anything this season is about consistency and whichever team is able to be consistent in the second half of the season will have a great opportunity to achieve a really, really good ending of the campaign.“Spurs have a strong squad, a large squad, they’re competing in Europe. They’ve got a strong mentality as a group and I don’t see them losing any sort of energy or focus over the next few months.“If anything, being such a young team, I expect them to grow even stronger. I see them as strong contenders for a really successful finish.”Much has been made of the attacking talent at Martínez’s disposal, with Gerard Deulofeu, Ross Barkley and Romelu Lukaku, the Premier League’s joint-top scorer, earning plaudits for their early-season form.However, Martínez concedes he is a fan of Mauricio Pochettino’s own forwards and Harry Kane, whose goal separated the two sides in the previous encounter at Goodison Park on the final day of the previous campaign.Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekend Read more“I’ve been a big admirer of this Spurs side,” Martínez added before Sunday’s match against Tottenham at Goodison Park. “What Mauricio Pochettino has achieved is a really strong team, very young, very athletic, with a lot of energy and with a talented front four that they can score goals from any situation.“It’s not surprising to me how consistent they’ve been and how difficult they are to play against. I expect Tottenham to have a stronger second half of the campaign, that’s why we’ll have to be at our best.“But, at the same time, we’re looking forward to that game because we feel that we’ve been a bit unfortunate with our results and a good performance against a team as good as Spurs, at Goodison, could get us in a fantastic position at the start of the new year.”The hosts will be missing James McCarthy as the Republic of Ireland midfielder suffered a recurrence of his hip problem on Monday while Tom Cleverley, who came off the bench to replace him during the 4-3 defeat by Stoke City, is doubtful with an achilles issue.The Everton captain, Phil Jagielka, will return from his two-month injury absence at some point over the next three games, although next week’s fixtures against Manchester City in the Capital One Cup or Dagenham in the FA Cup are more likely comeback dates.

Manchester United cut short Will Keane’s loan at Preston to bolster attack

Manchester United have cut short Will Keane’s loan at Preston as they “needed an extra body” to bolster their goal-shy attack.Louis van Gaal’s side have struggled to entertain this season and have netted just 22 league goals to date, with only 10 of them coming at Old Trafford.Wayne Rooney and Anthony Martial are United’s only recognised strikers after Robin van Persie, Javier Hernández and Radamel Falcao were allowed to move on in the summer, followed by James Wilson’s exit to Brighton on a season-long loan.Alan Curtis tells Swansea to be bold against Manchester United Read moreUnited can recall the England Under-21 striker but have instead decided to bring back Keane, who has scored twice in 22 appearances for Championship Preston.The 22-year-old’s sole first-team appearance for United came as a late substitute in a home loss to Blackburn on New Year’s Eve 2011, but the Preston manager Simon Grayson suggests he could make the first team at Old Trafford.“[It happened] in the last 24 hours or so,” he said. “United felt they needed an extra body around them.“Obviously it’s disappointing to lose Will. In the last few weeks he’s been finding his feet with us, but that is what happens when you get loan players.“We accept it. We will probably go into the market over the next few days and weeks to bring in reinforcements. Hopefully he will do well for Manchester United.”Asked if Keane could answer United’s goalscoring problems, Grayson said: “It’s a big step up. But he’s played regularly for us, he’s fit, so time will tell.”Keane won the Jimmy Murphy Young Player of the Year in 2010 and spent time on loan with Wigan, Queens Park Rangers and Sheffield Wednesday before joining Preston on a season-long loan.

Villa go to the Stadium of Light for a basement battle with the second-bottom Black Cats four points above them in the Premier League.Garde’s side have not won in the league since the opening day of the season and are on a club record run of 18 games without a victory. The Frenchman has spoken about how his players are lacking confidence because of their run but said they can change their mentality.“When you lose so many games at the start of the season, the impact of this is probably huge,” he said. “This is why I am always talking about the fragility and lack of confidence within the team.“Saying that the solution is within the team and within the dressing room – it’s nowhere else. You have to analyse what happened individually but then say: ‘I have pride, I am healthy, I am fit, I want to win games’ and then: ‘I have to behave like that’.“If not you say: ‘I have this problem, the team has this problem’ and you never go forward. I feel champions are very strong in the mind. I have to be as well. I have to build the atmosphere that will allow the players to flourish.“For me when I was a player, in every successful team I played with, I knew what I had to do on the pitch. For me this is very important. That stuff is my job.”Garde is without the suspended Jordan Ayew and Ashley Westwood while Gabriel Agbonlahor (back) and Carlos Sanchez (hamstring) are absent.

Xherdan Shaqiri, Stoke’s Power Cube with the Kung Fu Panda touches
~~AUTHOR~~
Barney Ronay
~CONTENTS~
Stoke-on-Trent has always been a slightly unusual place, part of its charm the sense of separation, a federation of six towns strung together into one municipal entity in the early 20th century, a kind of north Staffordshire soviet union.With this in mind there is something quite fitting and poetic about Mark Hughes’s attempts to reconstruct a working version of the former Yugoslavia across Stoke City’s evolving forward line. So far Xherdan Shaqiri, Bojan Krkic and Marko Arnautovic have been on the pitch together only 13 times in the Premier League but already they look like a wonderfully bold and charismatic trio, with Krkic providing the subtlety, Arnautovic the swagger and Shaqiri his own high-grade attacking gunpowder.It is an intriguing mix, not least for its tangled hereditary threads. Shaqiri is a naturalised Swiss and by birth a Kosovan Albanian from Gjilan, home also to many of the Kosovo Liberation Army that fought the Serbs in the 1990s. Arnautovic is Austrian with a Serbian father (some reports say via Bosnia). Krkic is Spanish but his father was a Serbian emigre in Catalonia.Jack Butland gives £5,000 to help GB deaf football team play at World Cup Read moreAt the end of which, Stoke’s attack is just a Montenegrin and a Macedonian away from a complete southern Yugoslavia diaspora, a Yugo‑Stokia of the Potteries complete with Kosovan nationalism, Albanian shades, intermingled sects, and bonded by the obvious delight the current trio take in each other’s on-field company.This is perhaps one for the longer transfer plan. For now they are simply the Premier League’s hottest attack. Stoke were bottom of the table in September. In October the BMX front line (yes, sorry) began to gel. Since when they’ve scored 12 of Stoke’s last 13 Premier League goals and out-passed and out-thought Manchester City, Chelsea and Manchester United.There is clearly a profound chemistry here, a function not so much of displaced ethnicity, more of some obvious shared footballing traits. All three were junior stars. All three have drifted a little and found a home again in the Premier League’s prosperous middle classes.Of the three, Shaqiri is the most interesting. There has been a lot of talk this week about whether Stoke’s spectacular, improbable No22 really meant the spectacular, improbable goal he scored against Everton, a lovely little dink on the run that drifted like a soap bubble over Tim Howard and tickled its way down lovingly into the back of the net.It is, of course, a silly question. Of course he meant it! This is Shaqiri, the Magic Dwarf, the Power Cube, curator of improbable moments, perhaps the only Premier League player out there capable of scoring a goal so brilliant that to the uninitiated it looks like – of all things – a scuffed cross. Shaqiri doesn’t scuff. He gilds and polishes, he nudges and prompts.Except, it turns out, it was actually a scuffed cross. Shaqiri initially said he meant it. Then he later admitted to Charlie Adam that, yes, it was a scuffed cross. And yet, for all that it was in its own way the perfect Shaqiri goal: thrilling, moreish, confusing, illusory.With Shaqiri you’re either a believer or you’re not. For me, it happened in São Paulo at Brazil 2014, when for an hour Shaqiri was the best player on the pitch by some distance as Switzerland lost 1-0 to Argentina. There was a moment when he just decided to stop for a bit and toy with Argentina’s defence, zipping the ball about, juggling it, producing a muscular little volley of Kung Fu Panda stepovers, bringing the crowd to its feet, the most inventively “Brazilian” performance of the World Cup from a player who, quite frankly, can do anything with the ball, whose basic talent in possession is a match for anyone, anywhere.And now here he is at Stoke, confusing people. But then football has never really known what to do with Shaqiri. For all his obvious brilliance, his 51 caps, those five league titles in five years in Switzerland, with Basel, and Germany, Shaqiri’s virtuosity has so far expressed itself as a series of moments. Stoke are his fourth club in three years. Under Pep Guardiola at Bayern Munich and Roberto Mancini at Internazionale he started 21 league games over two injury‑addled seasons. It is tempting to see him as an adornment, a decorative treat, a one-man highlights reel of rubbery, inventive malevolence.It must be said there is a kind of comedy in his style, this muscle‑bound red square of a footballer, Mr Strong made flesh, producing from those bulging calves and thighs a range of beautifully soft touches, precision passes, feet that flicker and dance. Shaqiri is a natural No10, a left-sided creator or right-sided goalscorer cutting on to his hammer of a left foot. And yet at the age of 24 his chief accomplishment is arguably his status as the best nutmegger in world football, a nutmegger of genuine variety and invention, whose nutmeg stats, were they ever to be properly compiled, would be off the charts.The real tease with Shaqiri is that he can clearly do so much more. Even in thin times his best tends to come against the best. The hope is he will be given a chance to find a more sustained rhythm in England, or at least a more permanent home. There has been a familiar pattern to these things in recent years. Success outside the Premier League elite can go on for only so long. Money tends to intervene. Stoke’s attacking trio aren’t yet so irresistible they must be hived off and lured away but Shaqiri in particular is likely to be offered another shot at a Champions League club if he keeps it up.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Xherdan Shaqiri scores his second goal in Stoke’s win at Everton. Photograph: Clive Brunskill/Getty ImagesOr perhaps not this time. The best part of the current inside-out season has been a levelling of influence. This week Shaqiri himself has been insisting Stoke can make the Champions League spots. And really, why not? It is a stunning piece of management by Hughes to see in these three a complete, functioning front line. None is a prolific scorer or a central striker. All three work furiously, break with speed or keep the ball, and find space in tricky areas. Together they cost £16m. Some say Hughes deserves a shot at the United job. If so it may be a good idea to bump this one right up the top of the CV.On the other hand he could simply stay and wring the most out of this evolving team. If a ball-playing Kosovan Albanian, a Catalan-Serb No10 and a reformed Austro-Serb wild man with a silent movie boxer’s swagger can carry on illuminating the Potteries, then most things are possible from here.

Gary Neville says Valencia will not rush into transfer market after derby defeat
~CONTENTS~
Gary Neville has said Valencia will not rush to spend in the winter transfer window.Gary Neville: Valencia job not a stepping stone to Manchester United or England Read moreNeville presided over his first La Liga defeat on Thursday as Villarreal claimed a 1-0 home victory in the derby. The former Manchester United defender has not enjoyed a win in three league games since taking on his first club job as a coach, and Valencia have drifted 11 points away from a Champions League place.They have also lost in the Champions League to Lyon, and the only win under Neville came in the Copa del Rey against minnows Barakaldo.But Neville was impressed with the second-half show from his team against Villarreal, whose winner was a brilliant free-kick from the captain, Bruno Soriano.He said: “It’s easy to say: ‘Let’s lose a game of football then jump into the transfer market,’ but that’s not how football should work for me. I’ve got five or six players returning between two to three days and two to three weeks. When the squad gets back to full fitness, at that point it’s time to assess whether the squad needs strengthening. We will score goals if we play like we did in the second half.”The transfer window opens on Saturday and Neville will have a month in which to determine whether his squad needs strengthening. He appreciates the distance to fourth place is a concern, with Villarreal currently the team in that prized last Champions League slot.Neville said: “It was the best, most controlled 45 minutes I’ve had since I’ve been here, so I take the positives out of that, but obviously it’s a huge disappointment because it means we’re further behind Villarreal in the league, we’ve lost the game and we have to recover quickly now.“I accept defeat makes it more difficult for us but there are so many points to play for. Of course I want results, I am desperate for results as are the players, but what I’m equally desperate for is good performances.”

Alan Curtis tells Swansea to be bold against Manchester United
~CONTENTS~
Swansea City’s caretaker manager, Alan Curtis, has called on his players to adopt a bold approach at Old Trafford as Louis van Gaal’s “ghost team” return to haunt himThe Welsh club would become only the third team in the Premier League era after Liverpool (December 2000-January 2002) and Manchester City (April 2013-November 2014) to beat United on four successive occasions should they produce another upset on Saturday.Those three previous victories have all come against Van Gaal, hence the United manager’s reference to Swansea as his “ghost team” at his pre-match press conference, and another defeat for the Red Devils could have consequences for the Dutchman’s future at Old Trafford.“We’ve done exceptionally well against United in the last three fixtures and confidence is creeping back into the team,” Curtis acknowledged on the back of a three-game unbeaten run that has lifted Swansea two points above the relegation zone.“We’re aware of United’s strengths but we have to be bold and play our football. We have to show the same spirit we have done in the last couple of weeks and play exceptionally well again.”United are suffering their worst run for 26 seasons having failed to win any of their last eight fixtures. In that time they have crashed out of the Champions League and dropped from top spot to sixth in the Premier League and lie nine points adrift of the leaders, Arsenal.However, Curtis said he saw signs of improvement during United’s goalless home draw with Chelsea last Monday. “The results there have been a bit indifferent in the last few weeks but I thought they were excellent against Chelsea,” Curtis said. “They didn’t win the game but it could easily have swung their way.“It’s always a huge test playing at Old Trafford and I don’t know if it’s ever a good time to play Manchester United. But there’s been a lack of goals with them, which has been our problem. So it could be a classic.”The contest sees Wayne Rooney come up against the England captain’s Wales counterpart, Ashley Williams, in what will be a rehearsal for their Euro 2016 showdown in Lens this summer.Rooney has only scored twice in the league this season and not once in seven attempts since a 3-0 victory at Everton on 17 October and the United captain’s hopes of breaking that duck will not be encouraged by Williams’s return to form.Williams was badly out of sorts during the final weeks of Garry Monk’s managerial reign but he has impressed since Curtis took charge last month and the Crystal Palace manager, Alan Pardew, described him as outstanding after Monday’s goalless draw at Selhurst Park.“The last four games Ash has been immense,” Curtis said. “His levels of consistency have been so high for so many seasons that I think when he slips below that it becomes really noticeable. But Ash was a warrior on Monday and we need him to produce that now until the end of the season.”

The top 10 strikers in the Premier League so far this season

~CONTENTS~
The 100 best footballers in the world 2015 – interactive Read moreAt the midway point of the Premier League season it is not only the league table that has an unusual look about it. The top scorers’ chart after 19 games sees Everton’s Romelu Lukaku and Jamie Vardy of Leicester leading the way on 15 goals each, closely pursued by Odion Ighalo of Watford.Of the strikers who finished in the top five behind last season’s top scorer, Sergio Agüero, only Tottenham’s Harry Kane features in the current quintet after the decline of Chelsea’s Diego Costa, among others, and the emergence of several new faces.Here is the Guardian’s ranking of the 10 best strikers in the league this season, based on stats provided by Opta.1 Romelu Lukaku, EvertonThe £28m Everton paid to sign the Belgium international from Chelsea raised a few eyebrows on Merseyside at the time but it now looks a very shrewd investment. As well as being joint-top scorer with 15 goals Lukaku has laid on four assists and created a total of 27 chances for his team-mates, forming a burgeoning partnership with Gerard Deulofeu. His mobility and first touch have both improved hugely since arriving at Goodison Park, while the natural finishing ability that saw him end as top scorer in the Belgium league aged 17 has been sharpened to devastating effect. Ed AaronsGoals 15Minutes per goal 111.6Shot conversion rate 29.4%Assists 4 2 Jamie Vardy, LeicesterHis spectacular run of scoring in 11 successive Premier League matches will live long in the memory for all Leicester fans but it still may not be enough for Vardy’s hopes of establishing himself as a regular for England. Roy Hodgson has so far proved reluctant to trust the league’s joint-top scorer with a central role and his miss against Manchester City on Tuesday will not have helped his cause. Yet for a player who has worked his way up from Stocksbridge Park Steels in the Northern Premier League to the very highest level, there is no reason to suggest he cannot continue to confound expectations. EAGoals 15Minutes per goal 110.9Shot conversion rate 28.8%Assists 33 Odion Ighalo, WatfordAt the back end of last season Ighalo was not even a guaranteed starter for Watford in the Championship, which makes his blistering start to life in the Premier League all the more remarkable. Nobody has managed more shots than Ighalo this season but a big reason for his success and 14 goals has been his partnership with Troy Deeney in an era when strike duos are thoroughly unfashionable. Deeney, previously very much a centre-forward, has adapted to almost a supporting role, providing the bullets for Ighalo to fire Watford to their current lofty position. Nick MillerGoals 14Minutes per goal 113.6Shot conversion rate 25.9%Assists 24 Harry Kane, TottenhamAfter his spectacular breakout season some may have doubted whether Kane could follow that up. After a slow start in which he failed to score until the end of September, the 22-year-old has emphatically answered the sceptics with 11 goals in his last 13 Premier League games and has once more been the focal point of a resurgent Tottenham side who go into 2016 fourth in the table. Three more goals in the Euro 2016 qualifiers have also put Kane at the front of the queue to lead the line for England in the summer, especially in light of Wayne Rooney’s recent travails. EAGoals 11Minutes per goal 151.6Shot conversion rate 22%Assists 15 Olivier Giroud, ArsenalQuestions about whether Giroud is quite good enough for a title-challenging team will probably dog him for the rest of his career but presumably they will not bother him at the moment. has 10 league goals in 13 starts to help the Gunners to the top of the table, with another five in the Champions League, two coming against Bayern Munich. What is perhaps even more impressive is that he has improved his all-round play too, his movement and link-ups with Mesut Özil a key reason for Arsenal’s position as title favourites. If he carries on like this, maybe they will finally deliver on their promise. NMGoals 10Minutes per goal 122.8Shot conversion rate 23.3%Assists 16 Troy Deeney, WatfordThe scorer of more than 20 goals in each of the last three seasons in the Championship, Deeney took 10 games to get off the mark in the Premier League but he showed there is plenty more to his game as creator-in-chief for his strike partner, Odion Ighalo. Five assists and six goals since breaking his duck against Stoke in October place the 27-year-old fifth in the total goal involvement charts, while he has also laid on 27 chances for his team-mates – the second highest. Watford have turned down several £10m plus offers for Deeney in the last two transfer windows and no doubt there will be plenty of suitors circling again. EAGoals 6Minutes per goal 283.6Shot conversion rate 21.4%Assists 57 Marko Arnautovic, StokeThere have been few more head-turning, eyebrow-raising developments in the Premier League in recent years than Stoke adopting a fluid and exciting front three and, alongside Bojan Krkic and Xherdan Shaqiri, Arnautovic has more than played his part in their success. The Austrian has been a driving, creative presence from a wide-left position, with six of the seven goals he has scored this season coming against Tottenham, Chelsea, Manchester City, Manchester United and Everton. Having frustrated since his arrival from Werder Bremen in 2013, Arnautovic is now well and truly Stoke’s man for the biggest occasions. Sachin NakraniGoals 7Minutes per goal 209.4Shot conversion rate 23.3%Assists 38 Callum Wilson, BournemouthHad it not been for the knee injury he suffered in September against Stoke, Wilson would probably have been a strong contender for a place in the England squad at Euro 2016 such was his impact in the early weeks of the season. Five goals in just seven starts means the former Coventry striker remains the most prolific marksman in the Premier League in terms of minutes per goal, while his shot conversion rate of 62.5% is freakishly high when compared with the rest. The 23-year-old is hoping to play again before the end of the season although it remains to be seen what effect the injury has had on his blistering pace. EAGoals 5Minutes per goal 108.6Shot conversion rate 62.5%Assists 09 Sergio Agüero, Manchester CityThe consensus is that Manchester City’s relative struggles this season have been down to Vincent Kompany’s injury woes but Agüero’s campaign has been equally disrupted. Irritating ailments have limited him to just eight Premier League starts so far, but he has still managed seven goals, five of which came against Newcastle in October. Perhaps the biggest impact of his injuries has not been the games he has missed (City have actually won more games without him than with him) but that he subsequently has looked a little off the pace when he has played. Keeping him fit and sharp will be crucial for City’s title chances. NMGoals 7Minutes per goal 115Shot conversion rate 21.9%Assists 110 Christian Benteke, LiverpoolIt says much about Benteke’s finishing capabilities that in a season where he has struggled to fit in at a new club and been hampered by injury, the Belgian has still scored six times in 16 appearances. Three of those have also been winners and one can only wonder how effective the 25-year-old could be for Liverpool were their manager, Jürgen Klopp, able to find a way of properly utilising the player in his side. That may well come in the new year, as could Benteke finally scoring when given a clear run on goal.

~CONTENTS~
Click to enlarge and debate the strip below the line.Keith Hackett’s verdict 1) You need to take charge of the situation. First, calm everyone down; second, consider whether the defender’s challenge was reckless; and third, advise the assistant that the game will continue, with or without his input. Tell him he needs to make a decision on the replacement quickly, or you will resume the match with his side reduced to 10 men. He needs to get a grip. As for the restart – if you booked the defender for a reckless challenge then resume with a free-kick; if you think it was purely an accident as a result of the wet surface, resume with a throw. Thanks to Sheikh Sal. 2) I’m not having this. Quite apart from the verbal dissent it’s clear that the defender deliberately aimed the ball at your colleague to make a point. Show him a red card for an act of violence, and restart with a throw to the opposition. Thanks to Alex Blakesley. 3) As every eight-year-old footballer knows: play to the whistle. The keeper should never have stopped chasing the ball like this. Assuming the spare ball was not directly interfering, I would award the goal. After that, though, I’d have to consider whether the game should continue in such high wind.

Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekend
~~AUTHOR~~
Barry Glendenning

Paul Doyle
~CONTENTS~
1) Could this be Van Gaal’s Swans song?Swansea City ruined Louis van Gaal’s first competitive match as Manchester United manager – winning 2-1 at Old Trafford last season – and they also inflicted United’s first league defeat this season. If they were to beat United again, then the calls for it to be Van Gaal’s last match in charge (and the undignified serenading from some quarters of José Mourinho) would grow even louder. This, after all, is a Swansea side that has plenty of problems itself: the Welsh team are without a full-time manager and have beaten no one other than Aston Villa away this season. Mind you, they have tightened up markedly under Alan Curtis and have not conceded for three matches. They would probably settle for another 0-0. What would that mean for Van Gaal? PDVan Gaal aims to end winless run against ‘ghost team’ SwanseaDavid Squires on ... 2015 in the Premier League2) The same old same old from Steve McClaren?Had goalkeeper Rob Elliot not been sidelined by illness, it’s safe to say the Newcastle team that lined up for consecutive festive defeats to West Brom and Everton would have been identical. Just before Christmas, Aleksandar Mitrovic and Ayoze Pérez were absent from Newcastle’s starting XI for that woeful performance against Aston Villa, although both players featured in the XI that finished it. That it seems far more difficult to get out of Steve McClaren’s struggling side than it is to get into it speaks volumes about the ongoing mess in which Newcastle United find themselves and how little their manager has done to rectify it in recent months. Newcastle have made no progress under McClaren and, having started the campaign with £50m worth of new signings and playing a possession-based attacking game, they have reverted to a turgid counter-attacking style with the same old familiar faces lining up in the same formation regardless of the opposition. Watching Jack Colback and Vurnon Anita sit deep against a team as hapless as Aston Villa – just as they do against every other team Newcastle face – it was difficult to avoid the conclusion that McClaren is completely bereft of ideas about how to outwit fellow managers, which seems strange considering his exalted reputation as an innovative coach, if not a manager. Furthermore, his ongoing reliance on the same players who continually underperform suggest an almost total lack of competition for places at Newcastle, which suggests things aren’t likely to improve any time soon. Newcastle have only beaten Arsenal once in 20 meetings in all competitions over the past 10 years, and on current form they are unlikely to double that tally this weekend. On the plus side for McClaren, as his monotonously predictable team takes to the field against the league leaders at the Emirates, he can at least console himself with the comforting knowledge that they are likely to have no shortage of opportunities to attack on the break. BGMcClaren has confidence in Darlow despite debut howlerPavel Srnicek: the Ostrava woodcutter’s son who became a geordie3) In the name of all that is righteous, Leicester must beat BournemouthThere is lots of admire about Bournemouth, including their run of just one defeat in their last seven matches, but for the greater good of football they must lose this weekend. Leicester must win. After two games without a goal – tough games, admittedly – Leicester need to start scoring again to show that their title challenge is not about to fade. The best way to fend off any transfer bids for their players in January is to keep alive the possibility of the most improbable and glorious title win in the history of English football. The prospect of living that dream would convince Jamie Vardy and Riyad Mahrez, already wealthy men, to eschew more material riches – at least until the summer. Hopefully. Bournemouth, who could be fined for breaking financial fair play regulations last season, are as spirited and dynamic as Leicester but have no chance of winning the title, so all neutrals should cheer for Claudio Ranieri’s team this weekend. Which means they won’t be neutral, but you get our drift, right? PDRanieri gives Leicester players a New Year’s Eve passBarney Ronay: Leicester ewoks stand up to Man City’s Death Star      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Leicester and Jamie Vardy need to start scoring again before their title challenge fizzles out. Photograph: Nigel French/PA4) More delusions of adequacy from AllardyceSpeaking after Sunderland’s defeat against Liverpool on Wednesday night, Sam Allardyce made the point that “we have to face the fact that you can always lose against Liverpool, even if you play at your best”. It’s a salient point, although the underlying suggestion that Sunderland were at their best in a very scrappy game against a Liverpool side, playing poorly enough to constantly infuriate their manager, will prompt alarm bells to clang around the Stadium of Light. Sunderland’s players couldn’t be faulted for their effort against Liverpool, scrapping for every ball, gegenpressing the gegenpressers and generally huffing and puffing gamely for 90 minutes, albeit to little effect. Sadly for Big Sam, effort and endeavour will only get you so far and when you’re as woefully toothless up front and porous at the back as his team continues to be, regular defeats are going to be inevitable. Having made fools of us all with their end-of-season feats of escapology in the past two seasons, it would be foolish to write off Sunderland’s chances of avoiding relegation this early in the campaign. Should they fail to convince against their abject fellow strugglers Aston Villa in the mother of all relegation six-pointers, it might be safe to do so on Saturday night. BGAlan Smith: Klopp loosens Allardyce’s straitjacketKlopp laughs off Allardyce’s ‘soft German’ jibe   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest  Sam Allardyce calls Jürgen Klopp a ‘soft German’.5) Liverpool feeling the power of LovrenJanuary promises to be an intriguing month for Liverpool: what signings will Jürgen Klopp try to make? Will he really give Simon Mignolet a new contract? And will Dejan Lovren’s improvement continue? We should get pointers about that last issue when Liverpool go to Upton Park. Lovren suffered a memorable shocker in West Ham’s 3-0 win at Anfield in August, but the Croat seems a new player under Klopp, as if his mind has been unburdened of those fantasies about daintily playing his way out from defence. Keeping things simple appears to have helped Lovren to remain focused and rebuild his confidence and, as a result, he has been quietly commanding in his recent outings. West Ham have several different types of attackers with which to test the Lovren–Mamadou Sakho axis, and it will be interesting to see how Lovren reacts if Manuel Lanzini comes jinking his way – to lunge or not to lunge, that will be the question. As things stand though, Liverpool fans can feel a lot more comfortable about it being Lovren, rather than Martin Skrtel, alongside Sakho. PD6) A rare sighting of the lesser-spotted BerahinoHaving failed to start a Premier League game since the end of October,playing just 90 minutes of football in five substitute appearances since, Saido Berahino’s relationship with West Brom in general – and Tony Pulis in particular – continues to show signs of strain. Amid ongoing rumours of Berahino’s bad attitude and poor time-keeping, Tony Pulis said the 22-year-old was lucky to even make the bench against Newcastle, but with Salomón Rondón suspended and Victor Anichebe facing a late fitness test, Pulis’s hand may be forced as far as picking his undeniably talented but wayward striker against Stoke City is concerned. Should Berahino fail to make the Baggies’ starting line-up in the absence of the two strikers habitually selected ahead of him, then it is surely a sign that his ties with the club where he forged his flaky reputation will be severed before too long. BGBerahino warned about behaviour but could start against StokeMatch report: West Brom 1-0 Newcastle7) The game in which Manchester City’s away slump could become a crisis“We are not where we should be in the league right now,” said Joe Hart after Manchester City’s midweek draw with Leicester City, before adding that his team is “right in the mix without really playing that well”. While sitting nicely poised in third place just three points behind the Premier League leaders will give Manchester City fans every reason to be cheerful at the turn of the year, their team’s baffling away form continues to be a source of alarm. Having failed to win any of their last six on the road, registering defeats against Tottenham, Stoke and Arsenal en route, City’s lofty league position can be put down to good home form coupled with the uncharacteristic weirdness of this year’s league. While far from do or die, visiting a Watford team that has won four of their last six matches will provide a stern test of the club’s title credentials and their performance will be viewed with as much interest by Arsenal, Tottenham and Leicester fans as it is by their own. BGBetter finishing will cure away form issues, says PellegriniExclusive: Manchester City target Schalke forward Sané      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Joe Hart says Manchester City are not playing that well. Can they end their poor run on the road at Watford? Photograph: Laurence Griffiths/Getty Images8) Norwich’s canny Thinkerman will be preparedNorwich have a dodgy defence and no deadly striker but they stand 15th in the table, and that is largely thanks to the shrewd management of Alex Neil. The 34-year-old spoke after Monday’s win over Aston Villa about how proud he is of his players’ ability to adapt from game to game to very different demands, sometimes having to survive on paltry possession, sometimes expected to dominate and always required to fight for their lives. What the manager did not feel the need to point out is how much he contributes to that adaptability: his line-ups are always difficult to predict because he regularly tinkers with his team to tailor a specific approach to each opponent and each occasion. And just as his tactical triumph in last season’s Championship play-off final helped get Norwich to the top flight in the first place, most of his plans this season have been sound, as have his in-game substitutions (the removal of Alex Tettey in October’s 6-2 defeat at Newcastle an understandable exception). It will be worth checking out how he decides to take on a Southampton side that head to Carrow Road needing a victory after losing six of their last seven league matches (OK, so they only actually lost five of their last seven, but the 1-1 home draw against the worst Aston Villa side in a generation must have felt like a loss). PDEverton’s Naismith in line to join Norwich for £8mKoeman admits Southampton may need a new striker9) Thrills and spills at Goodison ParkWill the Premier League’s best central defensive partnership – Jan Vertonghen and Toby Alderweireld – contain its most in-form striker, Romelu Lukaku? While that all-Belgian clash will have a big role to play in determining the outcome of this match, so will the confrontations between various young England internationals: Ross Barkley and Dele Alli have both been terrific this season, and there would be no better way for John Stones to reassert his class after some wobbly recent performances than by subduing Harry Kane. The stage is set for an engrossing game between two highly talented sides. The fact that one has a far better goalkeeper than the other could prove crucial. PDPochettino values Spurs’ squad unity over new signingsEverton captain Jagielka on brink of return from injury10) A depleted Crystal Palace – and no BamfordHaving celebrated his 100th home league game in charge of Chelsea with a 2-1 defeat to Crystal Palace back in August, José Mourinho can at least console himself with the notion that he won’t be subjected to Alan Pardew’s atomic levels of smugness should Palace subject Chelsea to another roasting this Sunday lunchtime. While Pardew has every reason to appear even more pleased with himself than usual, a mounting injury crisis, coupled with the suspension of Yohan Cabaye, will make his side’s task against Chelsea far less straightforward than it might have seemed in the comically bizarre closing days of the Mourinho regime. Following his brace against Watford on Boxing Day, Diego Costa will be welcomed back with open arms by the visitors, although one Chelsea striker we’re unlikely to need to look out for this weekend is Patrick Bamford. Having ended his unhappy loan spell at Palace by unintentionally offending many of the club’s fans with comments he insists were misconstrued and taken out of context, the 22-year-old might be well advised to stay away from Selhurst Park.

Football transfer rumours: Manchester United to hit the button on Mario Gómez?
~~AUTHOR~~
Paul Doyle
~CONTENTS~
It’s Louis van Gaal time! 2016 is the Chinese Year of the Red Monkey, and if that doesn’t sound auspicious enough already for Manchester United, then you should know that the club’s manager was born in 1951, which was the Year of the Rabbit. As anyone who’s hastily consulted the esteemed chinesefortunecalendar.com website can tell you, that means that Van Gaal is all set for a particularly happy year because “when Rabbit meets Monkey, Rabbit will become a favourite and popular figure”.Chinese zodiac sages do counsel Van Gaal against further jousting with the media – “You shouldn’t have disputes with others during this period” – and suggest “pay attention on your arms, legs, liver and nervous system”, but aside from those caveats 2016 will be a year of triumph for the Dutchman: “You’re the favourite person in your group. You will win good reputation from everybody … Your people relationship is pretty good. Everything will come in your way. The result will be very satisfactory to you.” So the only question now is: does Mario Gómez want a piece of that action? The rumours are that Van Gaal wants the Besiktas striker who was born in the Year of the Ox (or Cow) to fix United’s scoring problems and, indeed, the aforementioned site warns that “When Cow meets Monkey, it’s time for Cow to stand up on the performance stage”. So will Gómez accept the challenge? OK, since this is not the Year of the Dead Horse, we’ll stop flogging this riff now. But we’ll carry on with the Manchester United chat for a bit, as Van Gaal is also said to be scouting Fulham’s 19-year-old striker Moussa Dembélé. But the French forward has other admirers, too, including Tottenham Hotspur, whose fans may have to ditch that “There’s only one Mousa Dembélé” chant. Manchester City target move for Schalke and Germany forward Leroy Sané Read moreLiverpool are also looking at Dembélé (the young French striker rather than mercurial Belgian midfielder). In addition, Jürgen Klopp is eager to bolster his team’s defence so he’s checking out Martín Cáceres, the Uruguayan centre-back who is out of favour at Juventus. Inter and Fenerbahce are also on the case. Meanwhile on the goalkeeper front, there are suggestions that the talk about Simon Mignolet being offered a new contract was just a gag aimed at alarming Liverpool fans, with the club now being linked to several others No1s, including Marseille’s Steve Mandanda and even the Mexico international Guillermo Ochoa, who was outstanding at the last World Cup but has been mainly sitting out at Málaga since moving to Spain. If Liverpool go for Mandanda, Marseille will move for Ochoa.Norwich are also eyeing up Mandanda and the ambitious Canaries are also plotting a £7.5m bid for Inter central defender Andrea Ranocchia. Rémi Garde has been attempting to persuade Paris Saint-Germain’s back-up goalkeeper Salvatore Sirigu, to move to Aston Villa. Unfortunately for Garde, Sirigu has seen Villa play. PSG, meanwhile, are out scouring the world for the next superstar and believe they have found him in the form, and indeed the person, of Giovani Lo Celso, a 19-year-old currently with Argentinian club Rosario. Chelsea are also eager to sign the teenager: but Juventus are said to be closest to agreeing a deal. Rémy Cabella will soon make his loan move from Newcastle to Marseille permanent. Roma want to offer Mathieu Debuchy a regular run-out, and Arsenal aren’t expected to raise many objections. Finally, spoilsports Manchester City are determined to ruin the Leicester City fairytale – or perhaps make it even better – by splashing out around £40m to bring Isco from Real Madrid.

Roy O'Donovan says victim of his A-League headbutt 'deserves an Oscar'
~CONTENTS~
Central Coast striker Roy O’Donovan has apologised to Mariners fans for his despicable headbutt on Wellington’s Manny Muscat, but said the defender deserved “an Oscar” for going down.How can Football Federation Australia improve after dismal showing in 2015? | Joe Gorman Read moreFootball Federation Australia have confirmed that both players will be cited by the match review panel and are likely to face suspensions. The Mariners import said he was “embarrassed” that it had taken the gloss off the side’s first win in 11 weeks, but suggested he wasn’t the only one at fault.“I’ve got elbowed in the face not once, not twice, and the referee hasn’t seen fit to react to that and book Manny Muscat,” O’Donovan told Fox Sports. “I walked away and had a player run into my direction, I leaned my head in and I’ve reacted to it. He’s gone down like a movie star there. He should get an Oscar for that. He timed it perfectly.”The former Irish international admitted he could have easily been given his marching orders by referee Kris Griffiths-Jones, who showed both players a yellow card. O’Donovan felt Griffiths-Jones had dealt with it “sensibly”. “He felt there wasn’t enough force behind what I did,” he said. “I got yellow-carded and nobody got hurt. Manny played out the rest of the team, he didn’t have a scratch or a bruise. We shook hands after the game and I’m the only one that has any wounds from the whole event.”The 30-year-old, who has scored three goals this season, was apologetic to supporters and said he regretted his part in the ugly incident. “We’ve got a lot of young fans in the A-League and the Central Coast Mariners and it’s not what their parents want them to see and not the Roy O’Donovan I want people to see either,” he said. The 3-1 victory was the Mariners’ first since their 3-2 win over Perth in round one.

We can now move the team in a different direction.” Brentford manager Dean Smith said: “It was a compliment to us how deep Birmingham played. They frustrated their own supporters in the first half and they scored against the run of play.”BOLTON 0-2 HUDDERSFIELDDavid Wagner played down praise from Huddersfield fans after the win completed an unbeaten holiday programme with the away supporters singing: “‘David Wagner is better than Klopp”. Wagner said: “I think the fans are in euphoria. If you are euphoric then sometimes you say something you normally don’t say.” Neil Lennon admitted his Bolton side showed their fragility. “Huddersfield got the break with the goal and we seem to sag psychologically. Zach Clough had two good chances to equalise but scoring has been a problem all season.”CARDIFF 1-0 BLACKBURNRussell Slade said he expects Kenwyne Jones’s Cardiff exit to be completed quickly after the striker missed the win over Blackburn to hold talks with a club in Dubai. In Jones’s absence Joe Mason grabbed the only goal of the game to break a three-match winless run for his side. “Kenwyne was on a huge wage here so it is a financial decision. Hopefully it may allow us some room to do some January business.” Paul Lambert said: “We should have had a stonewall penalty. I don’t know how the referee missed it. But I’m not going to complain about it and get into trouble.”And the restSean Dyche felt Burnley were the better team in a hard-fought 0-0 draw against Ipswich. “It was tight. They make it hard, the ball comes forwards virtually any time it’s near their back line and we dealt with that very well. We did well with all the first balls, second contact, the ugly side of the game.” ■ Charlton interim manager Karel Fraeye praised his players after they battled back to draw 1-1 with Nottingham Forest. “The team showed fight and desire from the first until the last.” ■ MK Dons manager Karl Robinson refused to blame Antony Kay after the defender’s late own goal denied his side their first away win since the opening day in a 1-1 draw at Leeds. “Let’s not talk about it. It’s human error and we can accept that.” ■ Preston manager Simon Grayson denied he had to issue a half-time rollicking as they came from behind to beat struggling Rotherham 2-1. “There was no hair dryer. The players are honest enough to know that we weren’t good enough and they knew what we needed to do.” ■ And Reading manager Brian McDermott praised striker Matej Vydra for winning possession to create the goal that gave his side a 1-0 win over struggling Bristol City. “Matej worked his socks off.”

Mauricio Pochettino intent on finishing what he started at Tottenham Hotspur
~~AUTHOR~~
Jacob Steinberg
~CONTENTS~
As speculation mounts over Chelsea’s search for a new manager in the summer and the possibility of a vacancy arising at Manchester United in the near future, Tottenham Hotspur’s supporters do not have to worry about their manager deciding that the grass is greener if offers from bigger clubs come his way.While Pep Guardiola, José Mourinho and Diego Simeone have been linked with Chelsea and United, Mauricio Pochettino’s appreciation of young players, appetite for hard work, good humour, diplomacy and ruthlessness make him an intriguing potential candidate. He would certainly not be out of place at Old Trafford if Louis van Gaal leaves between now and the summer.However, Pochettino is determined to finish what he started at Tottenham and it was instructive to learn that he is involved in the club’s plans for their new stadium. Tottenham were once regarded as a soft touch, pushovers who could be bullied in difficult away matches, but Pochettino has altered their identity in the past 18 months.Given that they have the best defensive record in the Premier League, an exciting young attack and a clear, effective way of playing, finishing in the top four should be the least of their ambitions. Having lost twice in 19 matches, Tottenham are authentic title challengers.Pochettino is not getting carried away but even he can sense that something special is brewing. He will not speak about the title but he knows he is in a good place. “It is our dream,” the Argentinian said. “It is our dream to grow with these players and to be clever, and every season add some young players to refresh the team and maintain the motivation. This is our dream.“It is about the philosophy of the project at different clubs. It is difficult to speak about different clubs as it is all about what the club wants and the delivery of the project. It is true that football is about winning games. But you have different ways to try to win games, win titles and achieve big things.At a club where managers have not always been given time, Pochettino has a solid relationship with Daniel Levy, Tottenham’s chairman. “The important thing is to be clear what your plan is,” he said. “If not it is difficult if it is only about results. It is impossible to think about plans or a project. This is the most important thing.“The problem is the club need to be clear with the manager and say what they want. Here we have a plan. It is important now to set up all the bases, to arrive to the new stadium and build a strong squad and try to play for all when we arrive there.”A new stadium brings new possibilities. Tottenham have been given planning permission to build a 61,000-seat ground on their current White Hart Lane site and the £400m development is expected to be finished in 2018.“We are involved,” Pochettino said. “I think our responsibility is not only to win games and work every day at the training ground. The legacy for the future is very important. We are involved in decisions as we are football people. We are the staff, the manager and it is good that the club uses us to take our information and opinion. It is important to feel like a home and it is our family. You want the best for your family in the future. It is like your family and house, it is our responsibility.”This time last year, Tottenham were basking in the glory of their 5-3 victory over Chelsea, yet they followed that result by losing 2-1 at Crystal Palace. They ended up finishing fifth, tiring towards the end of the season, and they still have to prove they can last the course this time. Their credentials will be examined at Everton on Sunday afternoon. A fourth consecutive victory would be a statement of intent; dropped points would lead to talk of Tottenham’s unreliability.Pochettino trusts his young players. He values discipline and unity but he earns his squad’s trust and respect by not always coming down hard on them when they falter.“It must be with good reason,” he said. “Not just to be tough with the young players, as they cannot always defend their position.”Pochettino punched his palm. “It’s not that they’re young so I kill them,” he said. “I’ll do that if they deserve it, I am tough if they deserve it and need to be put in the right direction. It is like my sons and young people. Sometimes you need to be kind and friendly with them like a brother or dad, sometimes they suffer a lot and they are young in their mind and some players are not mature and you listen to them and need to apply the right psychology at the right moment.Tottenham can win the Premier League, says Everton’s Roberto Martínez Read more“You have good and bad moments and in our job we are friendly, good and kind. But sometimes you are upset and angry, and you are tough. We try to apply common sense because that is important. It is true, as it is in my personal and professional life. With my family, it is the same. It’s impossible to be kind 24 hours a day. But if you are upset for 24 hours a day there must be something wrong in your mind. I am happy with positive people.”

Chelsea’s Guus Hiddink: I want to see leaders beyond commitment
~~AUTHOR~~
Dominic Fifield
~CONTENTS~
Guus Hiddink has admitted one of his principal tasks at Chelsea is to convince his players they can emulate the leadership qualities demonstrated up and down the spine of the side he oversaw during his first spell as interim manager seven years ago.The reigning champions travel to Crystal Palace on Sunday without an away win in the Premier League since August but, having gone three games without defeat, on the longest unbeaten sequence of their title defence. Hiddink has drawn his two games in charge to date but has been encouraged by the commitment and intensity demonstrated in training and on the pitch from the squad he inherited from José Mourinho.Crystal Palace v Chelsea: match preview Read moreHowever, with only John Terry, Branislav Ivanovic and Mikel John Obi still at the club from his first spell in temporary charge in 2009, Hiddink is still learning about the characters of those he is now overseeing. “It’s a bit different from all those years ago,” he said. “I’m not going to say worse or better but different. It was a bit easier last time because we weren’t down the table and there were players with big international experience. Different types. Look at the spine of the team back then: Drogba, Ballack, Essien, Lampard, Mikel, Alex, Terry … the centre was strong. A different team with different personalities.”Asked if there were more natural leaders in that team, whom he steered to third in the Premier League, a Champions League semi-final and FA Cup success, Hiddink said: “That’s what I’m asking now of the players; that they must demand it of each other, not just in their commitment because they’re all committed. I’ve seen the intensity of training and the games but in the technical way of playing I like to see some players take the lead from central defence into midfield.“Tactically, you can do a lot with two or three words to your companion in front of you. We [managers] think we have a lot of power on the bench but that’s not true. You can just prepare the team and make the substitutions. I want the players to be in charge out on the pitch. To compare the team now to 2009, there were a few more guys who took that tactical lead last time. Now I’m asking these guys to take the lead – but you cannot blame these guys for a lack of commitment or intensity to their game.”The need to restore Eden Hazard, the 2014-15 player of the year, to some kind of form is obvious; the Belgian’s last club goal came against Crystal Palace in May. That header, after Julián Speroni had saved Hazard’s initial penalty, secured the title for Chelsea and, while the playmaker’s performances had revived over the latter stages of Mourinho’s tenure, he still awaits reward. Now fully recovered from the hip injury suffered at Leicester City and a knock sustained in Monday’s draw at Manchester United, Hazard will start at Selhurst Park.“He is back in shape,” Hiddink said. “You could see when he was warming up against Watford and he was looking at me as if saying: ‘Bring me, bring me on.’ That is an indication he can get back to the performance levels we are used to. He had a difficult game at Old Trafford, where they were searching for him all over the pitch, but he reacted well. Very strong, his character. If he does that he will come back to the levels we are used to.“I’m not a psychologist who tells my players to come in and lie on the couch and I will assess them professionally. I have short conversations in the dressing room or on the pitch with most of the players and you smell how they feel and how eager they are. They are not official sessions – but Eden smells well. His character is quiet but very determined.”

Roberto Martínez: Everton have the potential and talent to win titles
~~AUTHOR~~
Paul Wilson
~CONTENTS~
Having rounded off 2015 almost perfectly by moving stealthily into the top four, Tottenham Hotspur go to Everton on Sunday strongly tipped for a Champions League place and perhaps even a tilt at the title. And why not? They have a progressive young manager making a name for himself, a proven goalscorer in good form and one of the brightest English midfield talents to emerge for several seasons.It is not going unnoticed on Merseyside that Everton can tick all those boxes, too. Plus, in addition to Romelu Lukaku and Ross Barkley, the counterparts to Harry Kane and Dele Alli at Spurs, Goodison boasts John Stones, everyone’s idea of England’s first-choice centre-half for the foreseeable future. Everton, however, are not making designs on the Champions League. Everton are 11th.Everton captain Phil Jagielka on brink of making return from knee injury Read moreThe bottom half of the table is not where one would expect to find a team with three £40m-rated players in their ranks, assuming Stones’s value has not been adversely affected by his team conceding seven goals in their last two home matches. Naturally, Roberto Martínez denies it – this is a manager seemingly incapable of harbouring a negative thought – but with a new takeover in the offing, this is no time to be slipping down the table.Some Everton fans have never been convinced by the former Wigan manager, others have been pleasantly surprised but are beginning to lose their faith. Too many of the old failings from Martínez’s former club are beginning to resurface. Everton play attractive, adventurous football but too often lack a killer punch or a mean streak. They are frequently naive, drawing or even losing games when they have done enough to win. Defending is a problem, not only in terms of decision-making and application on the pitch but in terms of the manager’s ability to identify and rectify weaknesses. While no one is saying Everton will end up being relegated, for a club with lofty ambitions and highly coveted players this is turning out to be another season of underachievement. Martínez might have to repeat his cup-winning trick from his Wigan days to win over all his critics.With disarming frankness, Martínez accepts most of these charges. “As Everton manager, I take responsibility; we have to be a winning team,” he says. “We should be winning games and winning titles, not just looking to compete and hope for a win. Winning is in this club’s DNA and it has been too long since we won a title. We have the talent at this club: we are not quite the finished article yet, otherwise we would be top of the league, but we have to try to win something in the next five months.”That is quite a call from the manager of a club who have not won anything for 20 years but Martínez is shrewd enough to know that Everton might not always have players of the calibre of Lukaku, Barkley, Stones and Gerard Deulofeu at their disposal.The club manfully resisted Chelsea’s overtures to Stones last summer and will arguably be in an even stronger position to do the same again once the extra television income has been banked, although this is not simply a matter of money. All the above players know they could be playing at Champions League level, an aspiration that once again seems likely to pass by Goodison. Winning the FA Cup or the Capital One Cup would not necessarily plug that hole, although winning something would be a positive statement that might buy the club some time. As long as the trophy cupboard remains bare, Everton will always be at the mercy of clubs with deeper pockets and more impressive fixture lists because players want to test themselves at a higher level and are not generally in the habit of turning down better offers.Lukaku cannot enjoy being the leading scorer if his goals are not proving enough to win matches, he has spoken before of his desire to play at a big club and is beginning to sound a little fed up in his post-match interviews. Everton’s fighting stance over Stones could not quite hide the fact that the defender fancied the move. Much more underachievement and Everton’s best players will be off.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Everton resisted attempts by Chelsea to sign John Stones last summer. Photograph: Ian MacNicol/Getty ImagesMartínez insists the overall plan is to improve the squad at every transfer window but his best chance of doing that is to win something with this one first – or break into the top four and hope that will keep it together a while longer.“We have the opportunity with this team to be something special in the history of Everton, our attacking play is exceptional,” Martínez says. “We need to be better defensively, there are no two ways about it, but we have two experienced defenders coming back in Leighton Baines and Phil Jagielka.“We have conceded too many goals and we can’t blame anyone but ourselves, but we have a pivotal month coming up and hopefully we can build up some momentum for the second half of the season.”The top 10 strikers in the Premier League so far this season Read moreThat starts on Sunday – and for a manager who saw his side lose their last two home games, the pressure is on against high-flying Tottenham.“If I am under scrutiny I happily accept it,” Martínez says calmly. “The Everton manager should be under scrutiny. That’s not pressure, that’s the nature of the job. I don’t want just to go through the motions, I want to be in charge of an Everton team that wins things. This job brings a certain responsibility, considering the club’s history, and I am looking forward to the challenge of the next five months. We should be higher, there is no doubt about that. But for our own mistakes, allowing teams back into games, we could have been around fifth, quite close to Spurs.“There is no point looking back, we now play everyone else again and we simply have to do better. We have to fulfil our potential, to show what we can do. I think we have enough talent and character in the team to recover.”

Thomas Partey sends Atlético Madrid top with win over Levante
~CONTENTS~
Thomas Partey scored his first La Liga goal as Atlético Madrid beat Levante 1-0 at home to go top of the table.Atlético lacked a finishing touch until the Ghanaian midfielder struck nine minutes from time with a shot that squirmed away from Diego Marino, the Levante goalkeeper.“The team is playing well and anyone could have got the goal,” Partey, 22, said. “I am still learning and by working hard I am having more chances to play.”Saúl Ñíguez almost gave Atlético the lead inside two minutes with a near-post header from a corner that went just over the crossbar. Jackson Martínez had an effort well saved by Marino before defender Stefan Savic nodded the ball against the top of the bar from a corner.At the other end Verza, the midfielder, had a golden chance to put Levante in front on the half hour but fired wide for the club that is bottom of the league.Atlético midfielder Koke then cracked a half-volley against the underside of the bar from 25 yards after 54 minutes and a cross from Luciano Vietto also thumped the woodwork.The home side’s attempts were becoming ever more desperate before Partey, who had been on the pitch for seven minutes, burst through the centre of the penalty area and Marino was unable to hold his shot as the ball crept over the line.Atletico have 41 points, two more than Barça who have a game in hand. Third-placed Real Madrid are on 36 points and visit Valencia on Sunday.

Manuel Pellegrini says risk brought Manchester City reward at Watford
~~AUTHOR~~
Jacob Steinberg
~CONTENTS~
Manuel Pellegrini believes that Manchester City’s comeback against Watford will restore his side’s confidence in away games after Sergio Agüero’s late winner secured their first victory on the road in almost four months.Sergio Agüero completes Manchester City’s turnaround at Watford Read moreCity looked like they were going to slip six points behind Arsenal after Aleksandar Kolarov scored an own goal in the 55th minute, but they hit back with goals in the final eight minutes from Yaya Touré and Agüero at Vicarage Road.Pellegrini’s side had not won away from home since beating Crystal Palace on 12 September and they came into the game against Watford having scored only one goal in their previous five away matches. “It was important, the way we won tonight, to recover the trust,” Pellegrini said.City’s manager was happy that his gamble of replacing Eliaquim Mangala with Wilfried Bony in the 75th minute paid off. The change left City with only one centre‑back on the pitch but it meant that Agüero had a partner.“It was important tonight to take the risks,” said Pellegrini. “We made the substitutes and it was very risky. When we took that risk by taking Mangala out, we had our best players trying to score two goals. I don’t think we didn’t play well. I think tonight was a good game. It was important to win after six away games.“We are thinking about going game by game but when you get a game like tonight, it is very tough for the team. We are unlucky to be one goal down after a goal that was not a corner and a goal that was an own goal. We took the risks. Fortunately we scored those two goals.”Quique Sánchez Flores could not hide his disappointment after his side’s excellent performance ended in heartbreak. Watford created several opportunities in the first half and Étienne Capoue wasted an opportunity to make it 2-0 just before Touré’s equaliser.The Spanish manager said: “I am really, really proud with the performance of the players. I try to take the positives. It is difficult to dominate like this. We were able to control the space. We played really well with the ball.”

Exeter’s Paul Tisdale ready to battle Jürgen Klopp in hipster stakes and Cup
~~AUTHOR~~
Stuart James
~CONTENTS~
Paul Tisdale has been discussing his reputation for sartorial elegance when the conversation turns to Liverpool’s visit in the FA Cup on Friday night and whether Exeter City’s manager will be sporting his 1950s-style pork pie hat. “Yeah, I will,” Tisdale says. “Although if it’s absolutely pouring down I couldn’t wear a proper woollen hat like that – there’s a point where stupid’s stupid. I’d have to put the wax hat on instead.”The second-longest serving manager in English football, and arguably the best-dressed, knows where to draw the line. Aged 42, and approaching a decade in the job at Exeter, Tisdale is a fascinating character. He is a forward-thinking man with old-fashioned values, which means staying true to his word – Tisdale twice turned down the Swansea job because he promised Exeter he would complete a five-year cycle – and trying to win matches “straight and proper”.He also looks the part. From tweed jackets and cravats to deerstalker hats, Tisdale has been there, worn it and got the Ted Baker T-shirt. As a leading ambassador for Ray Kelvin’s fashion label – the two are best friends after first meeting when Tisdale walked into the multimillionaire’s Covent Garden shop when he was a teenager at Southampton – the Exeter manager is capable of giving Jürgen Klopp a run for his money in the hipster stakes.Unfortunately he has already lost the beauty contest. “My mother-in-law fancies Jürgen Klopp and that gives us a real problem,” Tisdale says. “My father-in-law is a Liverpool fan and has been for 60 years but he has now decided that he wants Exeter to win this game just to spite his wife because she fancies Klopp.”Tisdale surely comes out on top when it comes to their style of dress. With his rather eccentric taste, the former Southampton midfielder has been compared to everything from an organic greengrocer from Shoreditch to a French cinema critic. Tisdale, though, is making much more than a fashion statement when he stands on the touchline.“It means today is a battle and we’re bringing our best game,” he explains. “We’re going to show that we’ve got some confidence, we’re going to be innovative, we’re going to stand up and not be pushed around. We might be a little bit different but we’re going to start off with an air of optimism and we’re here to do business.”Yet it still takes a brave man to don a pork pie hat while managing a professional football team. “Yeah, it does,” Tisdale says. “I remember the first time I wore the deerstalker hat, that was at Norwich six years ago, and I got some stick. I’d seen it at Ted Baker among the samples for future seasons, no one had a deerstalker hat then and I thought: ‘I’ll do that.’ That, or the cravat, or the pork pie hat or the tweed, ultimately it’s about saying: ‘We’re here, we’re Exeter’.“I’m not speaking out of turn but we walk out the tunnel and I’ve made an effort and I’ve got some belief in how I’m presenting myself. You look in the technical area next to me and I feel one-nil up already – he’s got his tracksuit bottoms tucked into his socks.”Tisdale is smiling but serious. Talking for more than an hour in the training ground office he shares with Steve Perryman, Exeter’s long-serving director of football, Tisdale is good company. He comes across as a deep thinker, erudite and conscientious, and it is easy to see why clubs higher up the ladder have tried to persuade him to climb a few rungs and leave Exeter behind.With Tisdale it is not only a case of what he has achieved at St James Park – Exeter were in the Conference when he took over in 2006 and finished as high as eighth in League One in 2011 – but how he goes about the job. He is involved in everything from choosing the kit to booking hotels, never mind coaching and picking the team. He even negotiated the kit lady’s contract for her because “she’s so important to me and the players, so that’s important to the club”.As for Tisdale’s principles, they are best summed up by the response he gives when asked what would happen if Exeter were beating Liverpool with a few minutes to go and whether his players would run the ball into the corner to kill time. “I’ve never uttered those words – ‘run it in the corner’ – in 10 years,” Tisdale says. “But I don’t think that is the biggest villain; the ball is in play, the player is not doing anything wrong – not that we coach that. There are plenty of other villains against football.“By that I mean more contentious situations where the ball has gone out of play and the goalkeeper is wasting time or someone goes down feigning injury, or the ball rolls off the pitch and the manager pretends to pick it up and misses it. For me it’s about respecting the game. You hear talk about managers winning so ‘let’s kill the game’ or ‘game management’. All that stuff just takes minutes away from the supporters who’ve paid to watch.”Tisdale suspects a childhood spent playing cricket may have partly shaped that outlook. He was a talented opening batsman, brought up on the idea that, “if you nick it, you walk”, and never wanted to give up the sport. Even now he is a member of MCC. “I managed to get myself into trouble by breaking my toe playing for a select XI against South Africa Under-19s, that didn’t go down very well. It was the day before pre-season started at Southampton. I thought that was enough.”He spent seven years as a professional with Southampton before moving on to Bristol City, Yeovil and Exeter, with spells in Finland and Greece in between, yet Tisdale paints an unhappy picture of his playing days. “I enjoyed playing but I didn’t enjoy the professional game at all. I couldn’t see any light in it. I was in the wrong place. I didn’t fit,” he says.“I don’t want to come across as too unusual because that does me a disservice; I’ve got a football element to me – I’ve been in the industry 25 years. But I was never myself as a player. My mind wanted to quantify and consider too many things. Actually, a lot of the time football is for those who don’t think too much and just play and be happy.”After “stumbling into management” with Team Bath, the university team that reached the first round of the FA Cup in 2002, Tisdale took over at Exeter four years later and made a big impression. Yet the fact he is still with the League Two club – Arsène Wenger is the only manager currently working in the English game to have been in the job for longer – has led some to question his ambition.Liverpool coaching staff asked to calm down after row with Sam Allardyce Read more“That’s a bit of a cheek,” Tisdale says. “I’ve had opportunity to leave, there’s been a couple I would have been very interested in but the timing was wrong and others where I don’t fancy working. But you can judge ambition in different ways. My ambition was to get Exeter into the Championship – that’s pretty ambitious.“I put my heart and soul into the job and I’m loyal to the commitment. I don’t think managers can always moan. Clubs get rid of managers too easily but then managers leave clubs too easily. So it’s not all one way. I’ve done right by Exeter, they’ve done right by me. I can’t promise how long I’m going to stay here. It’s a different cycle to what it was before. But I’m not out there looking or desperate to move. I love it. I’m not greedy. I realise what a lot of football clubs are like. I’ve got a family and I enjoy where I live in Wiltshire.”Tisdale talks with great pride about Exeter, where the supporters’ trust is the majority shareholder, and he makes a point of reeling off those involved when explaining how they have “built an incredibly respectable name as a community club in the south-west and as an academy club in terms of developing our players”.It is not so easy, however, to say anything positive about some of the facilities at St James Park, in particular the cramped visitors’ dressing room where Klopp will deliver his team-talk. “It’s a completely shocking experience for anybody,” Tisdale says. “There’s one bog. We’ve had the showers run out before – we hope it doesn’t happen on the Liverpool day. We’re not doing this to piss them off. It’s a stand that was built for football 110 years ago. The home dressing room is probably marginally better because it’s 50% bigger but that’s it. We’ve been trying for years to knock it down and build a new stand, and actually the planning application has gone in. So we’re trying to put it right.”As for the game and the presence of the television cameras, Tisdale ruefully makes the point that Exeter “know how it works” – last season they travelled to non-league Warrington on a Friday night for a first-round FA Cup tie that was broadcast live and ended in an embarrassing 1-0 defeat.Whatever the result at St James Park, it is a safe bet that Exeter will try to play football and that any stick Tisdale receives from the Liverpool supporters for his attire will be water off a duck’s back. “Well, water off a good wax jacket,” Exeter’s manager says, smiling.

Time for TV companies to be more considerate to common football fan
~~AUTHOR~~
Daniel Taylor
~CONTENTS~
It tends to be forgotten sometimes that when the satellite dishes started going up and the Premier League jumped into bed with BSkyB there was only one member of the established Big Five at the time who put a tick against the relevant box when the television proposals came to a vote.Manchester United, Arsenal, Liverpool and Everton all opposed what the pre-knighted Alex Ferguson called a “plain and simple rip-off”. People often accuse the big clubs of being greedy and running football for their own needs but it was generally the smaller clubs who voted in that deal, aiming for a slice of the television money.Massimo Cellino’s argument over Leeds’ televised games is half-baked | Alan Smith Read moreThe exception was Tottenham Hotspur and their chairman, Alan Sugar, will probably just have to live with the scepticism given that he ran Amstrad, the company that supplied the dishes. “The Amstrad connection worries me,” Ferguson volunteered after the deal was cut. “There cannot be a supporter who does not view Tottenham’s decision to vote for the Sky deal with a lot of suspicion.”Ferguson dedicates an entire chapter to his various grievances, calling it “Premier Nonsense”, in one of his early books, Alex Ferguson: 6 Years at United, and if you still like following football the old-fashioned way and dedicating your weekends around travelling to matches, you might appreciate the gist of what he says.“How much can you ask of supporters?” Ferguson says, noting the disruption of the new Monday-night slots and has lamented the way Sky were “bleeding the public dry” by requiring viewers to wire up dishes and fund monthly subscriptions. “It would hardly behove the manager of a leading club to suggest that people both in and out of the game have been conned, but I can well understand the ordinary fan in the street wondering,” he writes. “How the football people negotiating the contract did not have the savvy to know that once the agreement was signed the Sky people would fleece the fans, I will never know.”Almost a quarter of a century on, English football is so entwined with Sky it can feel almost like a trick of the imagination to think that a club with United’s power could initially be so hostile. Sky, according to Ferguson, were in danger of showing too many matches at too many inconvenient times, making it virtually impossible for some fans to get to games, and forcing everyone else to pay through the nose. “I can see conflict ahead,” he predicted. “I believe the game may come to rue the day we sold out to satellite television.”As it has turned out, Ferguson was mistaken to think crowds would dramatically recede but it is clear, just as he suspected, that many old-time football fans have been driven away and I know from speaking to José Mourinho this season that the former Chelsea manager thinks English football is straying dangerously close to saturation point. “In many countries, Portugal for example, people don’t go to football any more,” Mourinho told me. “They stay at home and this [television] is why. Why would a Portuguese man pay €50 for a ticket when it might be a shit game and he can stay at home instead to watch football on television? You, in England, wouldn’t eat roast beef every day, so why have football every day? It’s too much.”And the monster is getting bigger. Next season the Premier League adds Friday night games to the equation and, once again, there is the sense that television is God. It’s not just Sky either. BT Sport recently switched Newcastle’s game at Bournemouth, a 700-mile round trip, to a 12.45pm kick-off. The BBC have moved Liverpool’s FA Cup tie at Exeter City to Friday night, without a second thought apparently for the fans who will be travelling from Merseyside and there are numerous other examples of what Spirit of Shankly, a Liverpool fans’ group, described recently as “the contempt and lack of regard with which they hold football supporters”.It is astounding how often it happens – Middlesbrough to Brighton for a 12.30pm Sky kick-off being another example – and it is tempting sometimes to wonder whether the TV companies do it deliberately, if it means more people watching on the box.On that basis, many supporters can probably understand Leeds United’s stance when Sky’s camera crews turned up to get everything in place for the televised game against Derby last Tuesday only to find the doors padlocked. Leeds, to put it bluntly, are sick of the way their games have been Sky-jacked this season. It needed the personal intervention of Shaun Harvey, chief executive of the Football League (and formerly Leeds), to persuade his old club to open up but the standoff went on so long Sky had stopped promoting the game as live, fearing their cameras would not be allowed in.That dispute might have something to do with the fact Leeds’s owner, Massimo Cellino, rarely misses a trick to take on the league. Cellino currently holds the baton in a long relay race of boardroom buffoonery at Elland Road. Yet Leeds do have a genuine grievance given their Boxing Day fixture at Nottingham Forest was moved back a day for Sky to show it live, meaning they had two days to prepare for a Derby side who look a good bet for promotion and had an extra 24 hours to recuperate. Whatever your view on Leeds, Cellino or Steve Evans, it cannot be fair that one side has been given three days’ rest and another two.The flip side is that fans cannot have it both ways. The transfer window opened on Friday and we all know how the sport works itself into a desperate tizz at this time of year. Many of the supporters demanding high-end transfers and vast expenditure will presumably be the same people who complain that television has too much power. Yet the two go hand in hand when it is largely because of television that there is so much money swilling around.The first deal in 1992 was considered enormous at the time, at £304m, whereas the one that starts next season comes in at £5.136bn, working out at an average of £10.2m a game for Sky and £7.6m for BT. It’s mind-boggling stuff.In 2014, the annual Deloitte Football Money League had eight Premier League clubs in the top 30 richest in the world. When the new deal kicks in, all 20 of England’s top-division clubs will be among that list. Bournemouth could feasibly be in, and Internazionale out. The last data had Burnley as bigger economically than Ajax, four-times winners of the European Cup and next season the team that finishes bottom of the Premier League – hypothetically, let’s say Brighton and Hove Albion – will receive £99.5m in television revenue. Bayern Munich, to put into context, took in £90.1m from broadcasting revenue, according to Deloitte’s 2015 list, and Paris Saint‑Germain £69.7m.Against that backdrop, it is easier to understand why the television executives think they can arrange games in a way that suits them rather than the clubs or the people in the stands. Sky, in particular, give us a slick product and if they wanted to be mischievous they could also point out Ferguson did not seem so bothered when the Glazer family started driving up prices at Old Trafford and, speaking of rip-offs, making season-ticket holders pay for cup ties they might not want to attend.It is just a shame that the television companies cannot be a little more considerate sometimes and that none of the people running the game, at the Football League and Premier League headquarters, ever seem to have the gumption to speak up on behalf of the common football fan. It wouldn’t take much and that it never happens does leave the impression sometimes that they really do not care.Who will extend Hodgson innings?Roy Hodgson has now clocked up 40 years in management and the Football Association’s chief executive, Greg Dyke, says the man who will lead England to Euro 2016 should be recognised as one of the most outstanding coaches the country has ever produced.It is certainly a great innings, taking in more than 1,000 games, and Hodgson is a prime example of how English football has gone back to the days when it placed great value in the importance of experience. Arsène Wenger, Claudio Ranieri, Louis van Gaal, Guus Hiddink and Manuel Pellegrini are all in their 60s. Hodgson is 68 and, wonderfully enthused, there are absolutely no signs of him slowing up.At the same time, it has also been made very clear over the past few weeks how the leading clubs still regard him as a manager for the middle order. Chelsea are looking for a new manager but nobody at Stamford Bridge seems to care that the England manager lives around the corner, with his contract due to expire this summer. Van Gaal’s position has been in doubt at Manchester United while Pellegrini seems to be on his way out at Manchester City.Three of the top jobs in England might potentially be available but Hodgson is never mentioned and if Euro 2016 does turn out to be his last involvement with the FA it will be intriguing to see which club offers him a way back.Don’t be sorryPatrick Bamford’s mistake after severing his ties with Crystal Palace was that he should have waited to have a proper conversation with Alan Pardew, as a matter of courtesy, instead of being in such a rush to let the world know. All the same, did he really need to issue a subsequent apology for describing his loan spell at Selhurst Park as “terrible”?Bamford was one of the outstanding performers in the Championship last season on loan at Middlesbrough, where he scored 19 goals. His move to Palace was supposed to be the chance to show that a player who could not break into the first team at Chelsea could still flourish in the top division. Instead, he has made nine appearances, eight as a substitute, and not scored once. Of course it has been terrible and we live in a PR-obsessed world if he has to show remorse for not offering a blander alternative.The strife of BrianSadly, the days appear to have gone when managers used their programme notes to say anything of real interest. However, Van Gaal missed a trick for Manchester United’s 2-1 win against Swansea City if we think back to how Brian Talbot greeted West Bromwich Albion’s fans to a match at The Hawthorns in December 1990. Talbot, like Van Gaal, had become vulnerable to the sack after a run of dismal results. “Good afternoon, everyone,” he began, “and, yes, I am still here.”

Scottish roundup: Kilmarnock hit back twice to deny third-placed Hearts
~CONTENTS~
Kilmarnock opened up an 11-point lead over the bottom club Dundee United following a 2-2 draw with third-placed Hearts at Rugby Park.Conrad Balatoni scored his second goal of the season against his former club two minutes before the break, making sure from close range after his initial backheel had been blocked, but the visitors went in level when Gavin Reilly netted his second goal in two games with a rebound from close range after Billy King had hit the post.Callum Paterson smashed home a left-foot volley from 18 yards for the away side in the 55th minute, but Josh Magennis rose well to head his 10th goal of the season into the roof of the net with 10 minutes remaining. There was some frantic moments as the sides chased a winner but the points were shared.Bragging rights in the 50th Highlands derby went to Inverness after John Hughes’ side beat Ross County 2-0 at the Caledonian Stadium. Miles Storey added to his impressive pedigree by scoring the opening goal, flicking in a James Vincent shot for his eighth of the season and midfielder Greg Tansey scored from a free-kick for the third time in four days to keep the home side in the top half of the table.Tansey’s delivery, swung in from the left flank, beat everyone and crept in at the far post. Storey hit the crossbar from 25 yards later on and Inverness thoroughly merited the three points. They now sit two points behind County with a game in hand.Hamilton snatched a share of the points against their own local rivals, Motherwell, in dramatic style as the Lanarkshire derby ended 3-3.Just when it looked like Accies would suffer a fifth straight defeat, Ali Crawford converted from the penalty spot deep into injury time, as Keith Lasley saw red for the home side.Scott McDonald scored twice for Well, finding the net either side of goals from Lucas Tagliapietra and Darian MacKinnon for the visitors. Louis Moult thought he had scored the winner with a diving header after 57th minute but the last-minute flashpoint ensured the match finished all square.In the Championship, Rangers stayed three points clear at the top with a thumping 6-0 win at struggling Dumbarton. Kenny Miller turned back the clock with his first hat-trick for the club since November 2010, putting Mark Warburton’s side firmly in control before Martyn Waghorn, Andy Halliday and James Tavernier rounded off a convincing win. The Gers had to wait 42 minutes for their breakthrough after making an indifferent start to the game but clicked into gear after half-time.Hibernian stayed in touch with a 1-0 home win over Raith Rovers, secured with a goal by Jason Cummings early in the second half.

Sergio Agüero completes Manchester City’s turnaround at Watford
~~AUTHOR~~
Jacob Steinberg
~CONTENTS~
While Sergio Agüero has been known to leave it even later before sparing Manchester City’s blushes in the past, he could hardly have picked a better time to offer a reminder of the devastating qualities that make him the most potent striker in the Premier League when his troublesome hamstrings are not playing up. Agüero’s first goal since 21 November was a wonderful late header that capped a stirring City fightback, earning Manuel Pellegrini’s side their first away win in almost four months and keeping them within touching distance of Arsenal.Manuel Pellegrini says risk brought Manchester City reward at Watford Read moreAs long as Agüero is able to string an extended run of matches together, having been disrupted by a number of niggling injuries this season, then City will be entitled to feel that the title is theirs to lose. However that belief was heavily tested by Watford, who were left to reflect on not capitalising on a breathless spell when they had City on the ropes early on and the moment when Étienne Capoue wasted the chance to make it 2-0 shortly before Yaya Touré crashed in the equaliser with eight minutes left.The winner arrived two minutes later, Heurelho Gomes rooted to his line as Agüero’s header looped into the top-left corner, and Quique Sánchez Flores knew that Watford had squandered a glorious opportunity. Watford’s manager could not stop apologising afterwards and while the manner of the turnaround demonstrated that City are capable of scrapping in testing circumstances, their overall performance left much to be desired. “It’s very hard, because twice in one week we have the same feeling,” said the Watford manager, referencing his side’s late defeat to Tottenham Hotspur last Monday.One of the most impressive features of Watford’s season has been their refusal to lay out the welcome mat for any visitors to Vicarage Road, as Liverpool discovered two weeks ago, and when Aleksandar Kolarov headed Ben Watson’s corner past Hart in the 55th minute, City looked ragged. They had little margin for error. Arsenal’s late victory over Newcastle United earlier in the day meant that City were six points off the top before kick-off.The signs were ominous for City in the opening stages, with Watford determined to demonstrate that they were not cowed by their illustrious opponents. Passing the ball swiftly and sharply in midfield and using the movement, brawn and skill of Troy Deeney and Odion Ighalo to great effect in attack, the hosts created four clear opportunities in a frenetic opening 15 minutes.Almen Abdi whistled a drive inches over from 20 yards and Ighalo had the clearest opportunity, spinning Nicolás Otamendi far too easily, only for Joe Hart to smother his shot. Deeney had a penalty claim waved away by Martin Atkinson, who correctly saw nothing wrong with Kolarov’s challenge, and the extent to which City miss the assurance of the injured Vincent Kompany in central defence was painfully obvious.Ighalo clearly had the beating of Otamendi and Eliaquim Mangala, while Touré, playing in a midfield two alongside Fernandinho, had his ego pricked by a couple of dainty touches from José Manuel Jurado.City slowly came into the game as the first half wore on, Gomes keeping out efforts from Kevin De Bruyne and Fernandinho, and some of Watford’s early zip had disappeared by the time Allan Nyom was booked for a risible attempt to win a penalty in the 38th minute.That shabby moment aside, Nyom embraced the challenge of marking Raheem Sterling with such relish that the City winger was replaced by Jesús Navas after 60 ineffective minutes, while there were times when Agüero looked like he was playing on one leg. The old Agüero burst failed to materialise whenever City tried to pick him out with balls over the top, and when the striker isolated Craig Cathcart on the edge of the Watford area, he was unable to slip past the centre-back and work the ball on to his right foot.Wayne Rooney to rescue for Manchester United against Swansea Read moreWatford were good value for their lead when they went ahead moments after Fernandinho had missed a free header at the other end. Ighalo hassled Mangala into conceding a corner on the left – Pellegrini felt that it should have been a goal-kick – and Watson’s cross towards the near post flicked off Kolarov’s head and past Hart.Pellegrini had to gamble. Mangala was hauled off and Wilfried Bony joined Agüero up front. Even so, the damage would have been irreparable if Capoue had shown more composure when he barrelled through and fired over with only Hart to beat.That miss allowed Kolarov to redeem himself by sending in the corner that Touré volleyed past Gomes at the near post, before Agüero sent the travelling fans into ecstasy, expertly heading in Bacary Sagna’s cross. Agüero operated on the fringes for the majority of the contest, but he only needed half a yard to leave his mark.

Louis van Gaal hails Wayne Rooney’s ‘beautiful’ winner against Swansea

Paul Wilson
~CONTENTS~
Louis van Gaal oversaw Manchester United’s first win in nine games and then hailed Wayne Rooney’s match-winner as a turning point for the season.The captain’s 77th-minute goal against Swansea, his 238th for the club, ensured he reached a United landmark and eased the pressure on the Dutchman. “Passing Denis Law’s scoring record is a fantastic achievement,” the manager said. “For me it was more important for someone to score today. It was a great goal, though, with his left foot behind his right foot you cannot imagine what a goal that is. And it came at the right moment, I think. I hope it can be a new starting point for us.”Wayne Rooney to rescue for Manchester United against Swansea Read moreVan Gaal also praised his players for their efforts in making his formation work in his first win against Swansea, at the fourth attempt. United played with three central defenders and no full‑backs for much of the game, which, as Van Gaal admitted, left large amounts of space for their opponents to try to exploit. “This win will raise the players’ confidence and lower the pressure on them,” he said.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest  Manchester United win over Swansea a starting point, says Louis van Gaal – videoAnthony Martial opened the scoring just after half-time and Gylfi Sigurdsson equalised in the 70th minute, before Rooney settled the game.Van Gaal said: “Considering the pressure we were under it was amazing that we performed the gameplan like we did, in a risky style against difficult opponents.“I am very happy that we won the match and happy that we scored two beautiful goals. You cannot win games without scoring goals, but just because we scored twice in the second half does not mean it was better than the first. As a team our performance in the first half was better. We only played with three defenders and we did not give any chances away. We also created more chances in the first half. In the second we created fewer, but we took them. That is important, as we know.”Anthony Martial and Wayne Rooney prove Manchester United’s ghostbusters | Paul Wilson Read moreChris Smalling disagreed with his manager about the first half being best. “We played far better in the second half and scored two very well-worked goals,” the defender said. “To see both our strikers on the scoresheet is a very good sign. We have dropped two many points for our liking recently, but at least we have made a good start to the new year.”Alan Curtis, for whom this was a first defeat since taking over as Swansea caretaker, said it was a decent display though not necessarily one deserving of greater reward. “We went for it a little more after going behind, and perhaps we were a little unlucky with chances right at the end,” he said. “We are not playing badly, but in our situation it has to be about results and not performances.”

Former Ivory Coast defender Steve Gohouri found dead in the Rhine

Guardian sport
~CONTENTS~
A body found in the Rhine near Düsseldorf has been confirmed as the former Wigan and Ivory Coast defender Steve Gohouri.The 34-year-old had been unaccounted for since attending a Christmas party on 12 December with the German fourth-tier side TSV Steinbach, the club he was playing for this season.Düsseldorf police confirmed there were no suspicious circumstances surrounding Gohouri’s death.A statement read: “On December 31 2015, the corpse of initially an unknown man was found in the Rhine near Krefeld. In the meantime, the dead man could be identified as the 34-year-old who had been reported missing on 12 December. An autopsy showed no evidence of violence by third parties.”Gohouri, a defender who played for the Ivory Coast between 2006 and 2009, scored two goals in 42 games for Borussia Mönchengladbach between 2007 and 2009, helping the side to Bundesliga promotion in 2008. He also played for Wigan and the Swiss side Young Boys.“This is terrible news,” Mönchengladbach sporting director Max Eberl said. “I got to know Steve as a person full of the joys of life and that’s how I’ll remember him. Our thoughts and sympathies are now with his family.”The defender, a member of the Ivory Coast 2010 World Cup squad, joined Maccabi Tel Aviv in the summer of 2012, and also had a spell at Skoda Xanthi in Greece before looking to finish his playing career in Germany.Wigan posted a message of condolence on the club’s Twitter feed, which read: “We are saddened to hear reports of our former defender Steve Gohouri passing away. Our thoughts are with his family.”

Middlesbrough’s Albert Adomah breaks deadlock to keep Derby at bay
~~AUTHOR~~
Michael Walker
~CONTENTS~
Even when you are top of the Championship, the Premier League can seem distant, but for Middlesbrough promotion is starting to look and feel close. An excellent performance against a Derby County side who started the match just a point away in second secured Boro a fourth consecutive victory and, just as impressively, an eighth consecutive clean sheet in the league.On the back of such runs are promotions built and Boro are four points clear of Derby, five clear of Hull City in third, and Aitor Karanka’s blossoming team have a game in hand on both.Karanka is not a man to get carried away, though, and while he just about accepted that Boro’s 2-0 victory represented their best display of the season, he was not throwing caution anywhere.It had, after all, taken Boro until the 83rd minute to break through – Albert Adomah chipping Lee Grant – and while the second from George Friend followed shortly afterwards, Karanka was keen to emphasise durability as a key asset.“Yeah, that was maybe the best we’ve played,” he said. “But promotion is in May, now we are in January. We cannot forget that we are playing really well and we are consistent, but everything can change. This league goes to the end.”Karanka added: “The main thing is the level of performance and the attitude of the players,” and he was correct. Middlesbrough tore into a game when others might have hesitated.Paul Clement acknowledged Middlesbrough’s start and its “intensity”. While the Derby manager said it did not surprise him, his team were taken aback as well as penned back. “Middlesbrough played a lot of good football; we weren’t at their level,” he added.It was only the second Derby defeat in the league since the end of August and Clement urged all to “keep perspective”. But by the end, when 32,000 people were dancing out of a bouncing Riverside, the defeat felt comprehensive.As Karanka said, this was about Boro’s attitude and that was personified in their captain, Grant Leadbitter. Leadbitter drove Boro from the kick-off, when he, Stewart Downing and Adam Clayton switched midfield play with tempo and precision.Whereas Clement had rested three players – Chris Martin, Tom Ince and George Thorne – at Leeds, Karanka named the same side who beat Sheffield Wednesday here 24 hours earlier.The team responded with shape and coherence, Kike missing a 17th-minute chance when teed up by Friend, and Emilio Nsue then squandering a free header at the far post.Johnny Russell rattled the legs of Dimi Konstantopoulos on the half-hour and the winger was Derby’s most potent threat. But while they managed to get themselves in the hosts’ box in that spell, the second half saw a resumption of Boro pressure.It built and built until the 83rd minute when the non-stop Leadbitter exchanged a sharp one-two on the edge of the area with Downing. Leadbitter’s next touch found Adomah behind the Derby defence and his finish was deft.The Riverside was still digesting it when Leadbitter supplied Christian Stuani, whose optimistic shot was deflected into the path of substitute David Nugent. Nugent’s cross meant Friend’s goal was a formality – even the obdurate Richard Keogh was flattened.Derby could not reply. It means the last opposing player to score at the Riverside in the Championship is Brentford’s Lasse Vibe on 15 September. During the course of the second half, Boro also passed a milestone of minutes without conceding a league goal – it’s now 727. Minute by minute they are heading back to the Premier League.Football League: your thoughts Read more

Anthony Martial and Wayne Rooney prove Manchester United’s ghostbusters
~~AUTHOR~~
Paul Wilson
~CONTENTS~
Louis van Gaal refers to Swansea City as his ghost team, aware that he had lost his three previous meetings with the Welsh club, so clearly what was needed here was a ghostbuster.There was definitely something strange in the neighbourhood, with Manchester United looking for their first win in nine games. Something weird and it don’t look good? That would be the football that has been sending people to sleep. So who ya gonna call? Wayne Rooney? Side-netting after 20 minutes, then he headed into the ground from Ashley Young’s cross just before the interval. Juan Mata? Needed too much time on the half-hour after taking up a good position from a quick free-kick, then shot straight at Lukasz Fabianski with a brief chance before the break. Sir Alex Ferguson? Spent part of the first half looking at his phone rather than watching the game. Daley Blind? Tripped up on a strip of artificial turf in the act of sending over what became a tame early corner.The list could be extended, but you get the idea. When even bits of the Old Trafford surface are conspiring to thwart Van Gaal’s players it is no wonder they have not managed to treat their home crowd to a first-half goal since September and even that was a penalty. Perhaps their beleaguered manager is right to be stressing the supernatural note. No first-half goals for nine successive games is almost as weird as eight games without a win.Certainly, as the first 45 minutes of 2016 came to a close with a Rooney header straight into the Swansea’s goalkeeper’s midriff, it was possible to feel a little sympathy for Van Gaal. There is not much a manager can do with a team that is creating chances but not taking them. He can fiddle with the formation, this one was a slightly risky 3-2-4-1 that involved playing without full-backs, but up front it was a familiar enough story.United started briskly, failed to take an early lead, then seemed to shrink in confidence in front of goal and allow Swansea to settle into the game. “This is Old Trafford, by the way,” the announcer said between spinning records during the interval. He did not mean it as an admonishment to the players, who by then had left the pitch, yet one had the feeling a few people needed reminding.If so, it seemed to work. Anthony Martial emerged as a potential saviour right at the start of the second half when he deftly converted a cross Rooney had been unable to reach, although United have led against Swansea before and still managed to lose. The real ghostbuster in any case was Ashley Young, who had provided the cross and was proving so effective in an advanced position it was hard to work out why anyone thought it was a good idea to deploy him as a full-back, but United still had to either build on their lead or hold on to it.Wayne Rooney to rescue for Manchester United against Swansea Read moreThe early signs were not promising. After Bastian Schweinsteiger had given the ball away with an unnecessary bit of showboating André Ayew struck an upright with a header from Gylfi Sigurdsson’s cross, then Àngel Rangel was rather harshly booked for a dive when Matteo Darmian brought him down in the area.With Young continuing to impress until he picked up an injury, Martial looking dangerous and even Rooney running about with more purpose than of late, at least United attempted to keep pressure on the Swansea defence and play most of the rest of the game in their opponents’ half.Rooney and Martial combined threateningly in the closest United came to extending their lead, seconds before Sigurdsson pegged the home side back with a neat looping header that David de Gea could not reach. Again much of the credit belonged to the provider, substitute Modou Barrow doing exceptionally well to find space for a cross from the right, though to say the goal still needed scoring would be an understatement. Sigurdsson was surrounded by defenders and had to stoop to meet the ball, yet still got enough loft on his header to put it over the goalkeeper.Suddenly the stage was set for another 2-1 scoreline. Weirdly, once again, all the previous three meetings had ended that way, with the Welsh side victorious. This one was different. One determined run to the line by Martial, one vintage Rooney flick at the near post and United were back in front and the scorer was into the history books. With 238 Manchester United goals Rooney has moved ahead of Denis Law, with only Sir Bobby Charlton to catch.No wonder he celebrated vigorously. This time a week ago the United captain had been dropped. Now everything looks rosy again, even if Fabianski did produce a heart-stopping moment at the death by coming up for the last corner and putting a firm header narrowly wide.Whisper it, but this was quite an exciting game. The good news for Old Trafford in the new year is that entertainment might be making a reappearance, in which case all the dross from the end of last year can be quickly forgotten about. Ghostbusters might be overstating the case, but United did look more like a reincarnation of their previous selves.

ChampionshipAitor Karanka’s Middlesbrough beat Paul Clement’s Derby to win the battle of the top two, after two late goals inside 60 seconds from Albert Adomah and George Friend sealed the 2-0 victory. Karanka’s side are now unbeaten in their last eight matches. Birmingham saw off Brentford, as one club teetering on the edge of the play-offs toppled another. The hosts, who left out Demarai Gray amid speculation over his immediate future, clinched the win courtesy of a late Maikel Kieftenbeld goal. Ross Wallace scored a 30-yard screamer to hand Sheffield Wednesday an away win at Fulham and ruin Slavisa Jokanovic’s first match in charge at Craven Cottage, in considerable style. The Owls go seventh, while the Cottagers stay in trouble. Blackburn’s winless run continued in Wales, where Cardiff City continued their attack on the play-offs with a 1-0 win. Joe Mason scored the only goal of the game on the hour. Charlton secured a 1-1 draw at home to Nottingham Forest, but there were more questions being asked away from the Valley’s pitch. Approximately 1,000 fans protested before and after the game in the West Stand car park, against the current ownership at the club. Nick Blackman struck a last-gasp winner for Reading against relegation-threatened Bristol City to hand Brian McDermott only his second win since returning to the Royals, while Steve Cotterill’s side stretched their winless run to five matches and remain firmly in the relegation mire. Blackman’s 13th of the season moves Reading into the top half. Nearer the bottom, Preston beat Rotherham 2-1 thanks to late own goal Jonson Clarke-Harris. Tony Andreu, on loan from Norwich, put the visitors ahead before Eoin Doyle got the cogs spinning for the hosts, who are now 10 points above the drop-zone. Second-half goals from Joe Lolley and Mustapha Carayol earned Huddersfield victory at struggling Bolton while in-form Leeds rescued a point at home to MK Dons, courtesy of Antony Kay’s late own goal after Rob Hall had opened the scoring for the lowly visitors. Elsewhere, Burnley played out a bore draw with in-form Ipswich, but both sides remain in the play-off positions. Sheffield Wednesday’s Ross Wallace gives Fulham’s Jokanovic reality check Read moreLeague OneThe Coventry City striker Adam Armstrong celebrated extending his loan from Newcastle United by scoring his first professional hat-trick inside the first 45 minutes at Gresty Road on a miserable afternoon for Crewe. Jacob Murphy also helped himself to a brace for the Sky Blues, who are now just four points off the top. Sean O’Driscoll’s Walsall ended the day in the play-off positions, surrendering top spot to Burton Albion, after the Saddlers were carved open 3-0 at home to Rochdale. Burton, though, are still coping amicably without Jimmy Floyd-Hasselbaink and coasted past Blackpool 1-0, courtesy of Mark Duffy’s second-half strike. Justin Edinburgh’s Gillingham started the new year as they mean to go on, too, after a 3-0 win over Bradford nudged them into second. Chesterfield scored the most goals of the day – seven of them in fact. The Spireites ran riot at home to Shrewsbury, battering the visitors 7-1 with Lee Novak completing his hat-trick on 89 minutes, by which time, Jay O’Shea had already helped himself to a brace.Peterborough just love scoring goals. Even own goals! Jack Baldwin put the ball into his own net six minutes from time, seemingly handing Sheffield United a point but there was still time left for the visitors to snatch a 3-2 victory at Bramall Lane. There were goals galore for Doncaster, too, who ran out 3-0 winners at Southend, with Nathan Tyson rounding things off nicely from the penalty spot. Elsewhere, goals from Ashley Hunter and Bobby Grant were enough to secure Fleetwood a home win over Bury, Adam Hammill gave Barnsley the three points against Millwall, Scunthorpe and Wigan played out a draw, and for good measure, basement dwellers Oldham and Colchester shared a rather unhelpful point at Boundary Park. Heavy rain forced Swindon’s match at Port Vale to be postponed. League TwoOxford United’s star duo Callum O’Dowda and Kemar Roofe both scored late goals to earn them even more admirers and their team a priceless 4-2 victory at Notts County. The win leaves Michael Appleton’s side in the mix at the top, on a day when their promotion rivals all recorded victories. Northampton beat Barnet and Portsmouth continued their title tilt in steady fashion, with a comprehensive 3-0 win against Crawley. Matt Clarke, Marc McNulty and Gary Roberts grabbed the goals to send Pompey home happy again. And Plymouth continued their surge at the top of the division, thanks to goals from Ryan Brunt and Gregg Wylde against Carlisle, who hosted the league leaders at Blackburn’s Ewood Park following the damaging floods. Bristol Rovers moved up into fifth after the on-loan Cambridge United striker Rory Gaffney bagged his fourth and fifth goals in just four matches against Luton. His parent club struggled at home to AFC Wimbledon, though, with Lyle Taylor scoring the winner at the Abbey Stadium. Also in the play-off mix are Accrington Stanley, who beat Mansfield 3-2 in a five-goal thriller while Wycombe lost ground on their rivals after losing 2-0 at home to Morecambe. Exeter City will turn their attentions to hosting Premier League side Liverpool in the FA Cup on Friday, after losing 2-1 draw at home to lowly Dagenham and Redbridge, whose new manager, John Still, watched on from the St James Park press box.Matty Dolan gave Yeovil Town their first league win in 17 matches and the first for Darren Way, as the club’s permanent manager, following his appointment on Thursday. Dolan scored the only goal of the game at home to York to send the visitors bottom of the pile. Elsewhere, Stevenage’s Armand Gnanduillet scored his side’s winner over Leyton Orient and Newport County’s home tie with Hartlepool was postponed due to a waterlogged pitch at Rodney Parade.

Leigh Griffiths gives 10-man Celtic last-gasp win over Partick Thistle
~CONTENTS~
The substitute Leigh Griffiths’ dramatic late strike gave Celtic a barely deserved 1-0 win over Partick at Parkhead. The Hoops striker, who had missed the previous four matches with a calf injury, spared the blushes of Nir Bitton, especially, after the midfielder was sent off midway through the second half.Griffiths replaced Nadir Ciftci for the start of the second half after a dismal first 45 minutes from the home side and Ronny Deila’s men continued to struggle, with Bitton sent off in the 67th minute after picking up his second yellow card. However, in the 89th minute Griffiths pounced to fire the ball into the net and take Celtic three points clear of Aberdeen at the top of the Premiership.It was cruel luck on Thistle, who suffered their first defeat in seven matches, but it was a huge relief for Deila, whose side had failed to win in their last four home games.Befitting a side who had finished the year in such good form, the Maryhill men looked comfortable and indeed confident in a low-key start to the match as Steven Lawless sent a dipping effort from 25 yards past the far post.The champions’ response was a drive from Callum McGregor that sped wide of the far post before a Tom Rogic drive from outside the penalty area was saved by Tomas Cerny.However, this was no assault on the Jags goal – though there were loud Celtic claims for a penalty when Rogic’s shot was blocked by Liam Lindsay. The referee, Stephen Finnie, was unimpressed and the game limped on.Ciftci had the ball in the net but was flagged offside before boos from the home fans accompanied the half-time whistle.Deila put on top scorer Griffiths for the start of the second half in place of Ciftci but the nervousness in the Hoops defence – especially when Efe Ambrose was in possession – gave Thistle continuing encouragement.James Forrest replaced Rogic in the 64th minute to more boos from the increasingly disgruntled home fans, who were stunned soon afterwards when Bitton, booked in the 61st minute for pulling back Stuart Bannigan, was sent packing after a late shoulder challenge on the substitute Gary Miller.The dismissal stung Celtic into action. Forrest had a powerful drive beaten away by Cerny, who then denied Griffiths twice as the home side tried to increase the pressure.As opposed to settling for the point, Thistle pushed forward for a goal and they came close when the defender Dan Seaborne’s header was cleared off the line by left-back Kieran Tierney.With a minute remaining, though, Kris Commons’ drive from the edge of the penalty area was deflected high up into the air and fell kindly for Griffiths to volley past Cerny and into the corner of the net.

Sheffield Wednesday’s Ross Wallace gives Fulham’s Jokanovic reality check
~CONTENTS~
Slavisa Jokanovic, the new Fulham manager, said he is not the magician David Copperfield and that improvements at Craven Cottage will take some time after losing his first game in charge.Jokanovic’s new side lost to play-off chasing Sheffield Wednesday thanks to a stunning strike from Ross Wallace. It was Fulham’s 10th defeat of the season and leaves them in 19th position in the Championship table, only six points above the relegation zone.“It’s normal I am disappointed with the result,” Jokanovic said. “But I cannot be disappointed with the performance. We play 60 minutes of very good football, they score a fantastic goal and with this goal they get the three points. It’s a frustrating situation but I come here for working not to fix problems fast. I am not David Copperfield, it will take time.“It will take commitment from my staff, my players and all the people who are involved in this project. It is life, you have to work hard and we try and find the right way for us.“We have 71% possession of the ball but we do not make enough dangerous situations, we have to be a danger for the opposition. We are a very good team with the ball but we need to improve without the ball.“We are trying to find this balance between attack and defence. I expect a better balance and for us to be more competitive, that is very important for us.”The decisive goal arrived when Wallace cut in from the right on to his stronger left foot and unleashed a superb strike into the top corner from 30 yards. Wednesday are seventh two points behind Ipswich, who occupy the final play-off place.Carlos Carvalhal, the Wednesday manager, said: “I think we deserved the victory. The time we scored the goal was important because we were not playing well and Fulham had more of the ball. But football is like this and after the goal a lot of things changed in the game. Especially in the second half we had a lot of control of the game.“We created three or four scoring chances to make another goal. It was not easy because of the way that Fulham play but the reality is that Joe Wildsmith did not have too many saves to make and we could have scored more.“I joked with Ross that he never scores goals like this earlier in the week. I said he did it for Celtic 25 years ago but why not for us? Of course, I was joking, it was not 25 years. I didn’t make him score but it was a nice coincidence.”PAWatford v Manchester City: Premier League – live! Read more

Angry Jürgen Klopp claims Liverpool did not give 100% against West Ham

Jürgen Klopp could not hide his anger with Liverpool after watching his team lose 2-0 at West Ham on Saturday, a result that puts their Champions League hopes in serious doubt.Andy Carroll delivers knockout blow for West Ham against Liverpool Read moreGoals either side of half-time from Michail Antonio and the former Anfield striker Andy Carroll sealed a deserved victory for Slaven Bilic’s side and one that meant West Ham completed a first league double over Liverpool in 52 years.For the visitors, it was a second defeat in four games and leaves them five points behind fourth-placed Tottenham, having played a game more than Klopp’s side.“It was not enough from my team and I’m really angry because we could have got more because everybody could see in the moments we play football what could happen,” said Klopp. “We have to again accept that we didn’t play like we should. Who wants to see 90%? You can’t win a game with 90%. You need more than we did today. Two-nil? It’s deserved.”Klopp must now reinvigorate his side before their Capital One Cup semi-final first leg tie at Stoke on Tuesday and then they travel to Exeter for Friday night’s FA Cup third-round clash.For West Ham, a second successive win can be enjoyed before facing Wolverhampton Wanderers in the FA Cup at Upton Park on Saturday.“There are going to be ups and downs [in the league], but when we have the majority of players fit then there are very, very few teams that are better than us on paper,” said Bilic.

Barcelona denied by woodwork in Catalan derby stalemate with Espanyol
~CONTENTS~
Lionel Messi and Luis Suárez both hit the woodwork as Barcelona were held 0-0 by Espanyol in a hard-fought derby that could see Atlético Madrid go top of La Liga if they beat the bottom side Levante later on Saturday.Barça set a Spanish record of 180 goals in 2015 but their normally prolific attack drew a blank against their local rivals who were strong in the challenge, especially in the first half, and succeeded in disrupting their play.Messi hit the crossbar with a 30-yard free kick in the first half while Suárez, who has 26 goals this season, was surprisingly wasteful in front of an open goal in the second half with his shot hitting the post.Barça have 39 points, a point more than Atlético, with both having played 17 games. Third-placed Real Madrid are on 36 points and are away to Valencia on Sunday.

Jonny Evans strikes injury-time West Brom winner to down in-form Stoke
~CONTENTS~
Mark Hughes accused Claudio Yacob of getting Geoff Cameron sent off after his side slipped to defeat. Jonny Evans’s injury-time winner capped the late drama following Cameron’s dismissal minutes after Jonathan Walters had levelled for Stoke and looked to have earned them a point.Cameron walked with nine minutes remaining after he pushed Yacob in the back of the neck following the Argentinian’s challenge.But the Stoke manager felt the midfielder overreacted to leave the visitors with 10 men and he will consider an appeal. “We weren’t too happy with the reaction of the lad Yacob to be perfectly honest,” he said. “I thought he has gone down with the intention of maybe getting Geoff sent off and unfortunately for us that’s what he’s able to do.“We’ll have a look at it on Sunday and make a decision on whether or not we appeal against the decision. My initial thought is we probably will appeal.“It was unfortunate. Geoff has reacted to a late challenge on a leg he injured in the first half. It is understandable to a certain extent.”Hughes also felt that the late red card played a huge part in the winning goal. “At set-plays you are one man down and they are throwing everyone forward,” he said. “At some point there is someone free.“We could have done better to clear the chance, it’s bobbled across and ended up at the far post for the tap-in. We certainly didn’t play anywhere near like we’re capable of.”The defeat ended Stoke’s winning run and they struggled to create clear openings with Boaz Myhill saving from Glen Johnson and Marko Arnautovic before Walters finally struck.However, it had been a dull game before Stéphane Sessègnon’s first goal since October 2014 opened the scoring and set Albion up for successive wins.It was Tony Pulis’s third consecutive victory over his former club and the home side are now nine points clear of the Premier League relegation zone.Pulis said: “Irrespective of whether it’s against Stoke or anyone, the most important thing is three points and back-to-back victories. It’s a busy period and we have gone into the game without four players.“To put in a performance we have done without four major players is fantastic. Luckily for us it drops to Jonny at the end. He has been a great signing for us. He’s not just a good defender but his quality on the ball is first-class. He just oozes class.”Sessègnon looked to be out of Pulis’s plans this season but he has fought his way back into the side. It was just his seventh goal in two-and-a-half years at Albion and Pulis wants the 31-year-old to score more. “I pulled him [aside] this week. I thought he was fantastic against Newcastle and told him he needed goals,” he said.Wayne Rooney to rescue for Manchester United against Swansea Read more

Jermain Defoe brace seals win for Sunderland to deepen Aston Villa woes
~~AUTHOR~~
Louise Taylor
~CONTENTS~
It is a year since Jermain Defoe became Sunderland’s highest paid player after arriving from FC Toronto. Since then Gus Poyet, Dick Advocaat and now Sam Allardyce have all struggled to fit the former England striker into their starting XIs and there has been interminable debate about whether he should be off-loaded.Along the way though Defoe has scored a few vital goals and none more so than the pair he registered in the second half here. Accommodated on Allardcye’s team sheet as a lone striker supported by Adam Johnson in a new “in the hole” role, he justified such faith by reviving Sunderland’s survival hopes as they ended a run of five straight defeats.In truth Defoe’s contribution helped airbrush the flaws out of a less than convincing overall Sunderland performance on a day when the expression on Rémi Garde’s face confirmed that his side are all but consigned to the Championship.Villa have still to win since Garde succeeded Tim Sherwood and, afterwards he prompted questions about his future in the Midlands by body-swerving the post-match press conferences. Instead the Frenchman boarded the bus waiting to transport Villa to Newcastle airport. Once there, the temptation to check in to a flight bound for Paris rather Birmingham must have been overwhelming for a manager who declined to shake Allardyce’s hand at the final whistle.Victory kept Sunderland 19th but they now have 15 points, seven more than a Villa side increasingly stranded at the bottom. “Our situation is still dire,” said Allardyce. “We’re still threatened by relegation. We’re a long way from being safe. But when we needed someone to win this game we had Jermain Defoe.“There’s been a big thing about Jermain not being able to play up front but maybe he can play as a lone striker after all. If someone like Adam Johnson plays behind him and gets closer to him, maybe it can work.”Garde had evidently worked out a gameplan targeting Patrick van Aanholt’s defensive weaknesses at left-back. Accordingly Leandro Bacuna ran at him at every opportunity and, at the end of one such advance, Bacuna crossed invitingly to Jordan Veretout at the far post. When Veretout stretched to unleash a low volley, Vito Mannone – once again preferred to Costel Pantilimon in the home goal – did very well to palm it to safety.All clever movement and slick little passes while frequently operating behind Rudy Gestede, Jack Grealish was, albeit all too briefly, lending Villa an air of sophistication. Worryingly for Allardyce, Sunderland’s defence seemed to be having trouble decoding his passing radar.Indeed it was all going rather well for the visitors until Van Aanholt collected Yann M’Vila’s pass, galloped down the flank and dispatched a low, speculative, 25-yard shot which struck Micah Richards and, deflecting off the defender, trickled past a wrong-footed Brad Guzan. In a very Gallic gesture of displeasure Garde wrinkled his nose.Very much against the run of play, this cruellest of deflections arrived at a moment when Sunderland fans had turned decidedly edgy. Yet for all Villa’s dominance of possession, for all the pleasing little individual cameos from Bacuna their final balls – and particularly those to Gestede – lacked the requisite quality. Gradually Grealish also became a cause for concern, fading fast, he drifted to the game’s margins just when Villa needed him most.Allardyce’s manic technical area gum‑chewing suggested he was not overly struck with his own side’s performance either. Quite apart from offering minimal attacking threat Sunderland’s inability to keep the ball prompted alarm.Attempting to deconstruct them, Garde replaced Grealish with Adam Traoré. It was to prove an inspired switch. When Borini conceded possession, Traoré simply hared down Villa’s right, dodged the poorly positioned Van Aanholt and, with Wes Brown also left trailing, delivered a deep cross in Carles Gil’s direction. That dispatch prompted a simply stunning goal. Showing off sublime skill, Gil beat Mannone courtesy of a fabulous volley hooked acrobatically over a shoulder. Wow.Suddenly Sunderland seemed to have one foot in the second tier. The moment had come for Defoe – initially very big on economy of effort – to use all that cleverly conserved energy to remind everyone of his enduring ability and, latching on to Johnson’s pass, the 33-year-old duly obliged. Benefiting from Joleon Lescott’s exceptionally generous defending, he was able to turn goalwards before expertly squeezing a left-footed, near-post shot beyond Guzan.With Villa now looking horribly lightweight, Defoe intensified Garde’s woes after connecting with Ola Toivonen’s cross and sweeping a first-time, 12-yard shot home in stoppage time. A hat-trick beckoned when he subsequently pounced on a mistake from Guzan but the resultant effort was controversially deemed offside.At the whistle, Garde could not wait to beat a hasty retreat.

Wayne Rooney to rescue for Manchester United against Swansea
~~AUTHOR~~
Daniel Taylor
~CONTENTS~
As the Manchester United supporters headed away into the drizzle, there was at least a collective sense of relief that Louis van Gaal’s team had reminded themselves what it was like to win a football match. It had been a long time coming – 42 days, to be precise – and they had to endure a wretched first half. Yet the eight-match sequence without a victory, their worst run since 1990, was finally over and Wayne Rooney’s improvisational winner had soothing effects for a crowd that is used to better times.Van Gaal’s side made hard going of it at times and it still feels startling that Old Trafford, a stadium famous for its sense of high drama, has seen the lowest number of goals this season, 15, of all 92 league clubs. Staggeringly, United have not managed a first-half one in nine successive home games stretching back to 30 September and Van Gaal is being generous in the extreme when he says this team is still capable of winning the league.There was, however, an improvement during a second half when United took the lead through Anthony Martial’s header before toying with the idea of the game becoming another ordeal courtesy of Gylfi Sigurdsson’s 71st-minute equaliser. Rooney’s goal came six minutes later and should ease his confidence at a time when United’s captain has admitted being off form. In the first half, Rooney was booed when he played the ball backwards.Louis van Gaal hails Wayne Rooney’s ‘beautiful’ winner against Swansea Read moreRooney has now moved ahead of Denis Law to become the second-highest scorer in United’s history, 11 short of Sir Bobby Charlton’s 249, but his afternoon might still have been spoiled during a late, frenetic spell of pressure from Swansea culminating in Lukasz Fabianski, the visiting keeper, coming forward for a stoppage-time corner, leaping in the manner of a modern-day John Charles and flashing a header just wide of David de Gea’s goal.The final whistle shrilled moments later and United survived but it cannot be satisfactory that, 18 months after joining the club, Van Gaal is still experimenting with new formations and still a mile away from everything fully clicking.His new system here took some working out, veering from 3-4-2-1 to 3‑1‑3-3 and back again, and it is no wonder sometimes if even his own players look puzzled themselves. The football was leaden in the first half and, once again, there were times when an impatient crowd struggled to contain their frustrations.In other parts of the game there was a brooding silence. Old Trafford is not enjoying what it sees and Van Gaal should be grateful the fans are showing more restraint than he would have experienced at some of his previous clubs. At Barcelona, it is easy to imagine how vigorously the panolada would have been fluttering and it was remarkable afterwards to hear him say he was happier with the first half than the second one. That sentence, more than anything, sums up what an awkward fit he is at a club with United’s love of adventure.If that sounds slightly harsh after a return to winning ways, then it cannot be overstated how dreary United looked in the opening 45 minutes. At one point, the cameras turned to the seats where United’s directors and staff were struggling to hide their own boredom. Sir Alex Ferguson was playing with his phone. The academy coach, Paul McGuinness, was reading the programme and Nicky Butt also had his phone out. United were ponderous, predictable and prosaic and fortunate, perhaps, the referee, Jon Moss, gave Morgan Schneiderlin the benefit of the doubt after he had hooked an attempted clearance against his own hand.Anthony Martial and Wayne Rooney prove Manchester United’s ghostbusters | Paul Wilson Read moreMartial’s goal came two minutes into the second half with a downward header from Ashley Young’s right-wing cross and at that stage United’s crowd must have been encouraged by the fact they had conceded only three goals here all season. Yet the game opened up when Swansea’s caretaker manager, Alan Curtis, who had left Jonjo Shelvey out of his squad, brought on Modou Barrow for Leon Britton. Britton had been the outstanding player in the first half but Barrow gave the team width and penetration and it was the Gambian’s cross, having eluded the half-time substitute Matteo Darmian, that led to Sigurdsson looping a header over De Gea for the equaliser.Swansea could also reflect on André Ayew’s header striking the post at 1-0 and they were aggrieved that Ángel Rangel was booked for an alleged dive when he reached the loose ball with Darmian closing in. They gave everything in the closing stages and, as well as Fabianski’s attempts to give the game an extraordinary last twist, De Gea had to turn away a fiercely struck shot from Ashley Williams.Yet this was a day, ultimately, when Rooney turned down the volume a little on his critics. His goal was a beauty, set up by Martial’s driving run and low centre and turned in by Rooney’s left foot, flicked behind his right, to spare Van Gaal another wave of intense scrutiny.

Riyad Mahrez’s missed penalty allows Bournemouth to frustrate Leicester
~~AUTHOR~~
Stuart James
~CONTENTS~
After the feast comes the famine for Leicester City, whose momentum at the top has been checked after they failed to score for a third successive match on an afternoon of immense frustration for Claudio Ranieri and his players.Laurent Koscielny tap-in gives Arsenal win against Newcastle United Read moreJamie Vardy was denied by the woodwork, Wes Morgan filed a contender for miss of the season and Riyad Mahrez picked a bad day for that wonderful left foot to let him down – from the penalty spot of all places.The temptation from outside the club will be to say the bubble has burst, yet the margins were so fine it would be unfair to write off Leicester. Vardy looked as annoyed as anyone that he failed to score, with the England international booting the same upright that his toe-poked first-half shot had cannoned off, while only Mahrez knows why he hesitated during the run up to a penalty that was struck at a comfortable height for Artur Boruc to repel.For Bournemouth there was a sense that justice was done with that penalty save, given Simon Francis clearly got the ball when he made a last-ditch attempt to stop Vardy in his tracks as the Leicester striker bore down on goal. Andre Marriner had deemed otherwise, the referee pointing to the spot and showing Francis a straight red card that forced Bournemouth to play the final half-hour with 10 men.Leicester poured forward in that period but Eddie Howe’s team showed spirit and resilience to hold on and it was not until the closing moments that Bournemouth hearts were in mouths. Vardy again went down, this time under a challenge from Dan Gosling, and some players thought Marriner had awarded another penalty. Instead he gave a goal-kick and Leicester’s hopes of snatching a late victory disappeared.Ranieri refused to be too downbeat despite a third successive game without a win, with the Leicester manager promising champagne for his players to celebrate the fact they have reached 40 points and challenging them to try to do even better in the second half of the season. “When you play at a high intensity you can make mistakes, we made a lot of mistakes with the last pass – we were too anxious to score a goal,” said Ranieri, who is close to completing the signing of Demarai Gray from Birmingham.“But it’s OK, 40 points, clean sheet, champagne for my players. If we did 39 points in the first half of the season we try to make 40 in the second half. We are safe. We are doing a fantastic season, why not believe anything is possible?”Bournemouth started brightly and had two excellent chances in the opening 45 minutes. Josh King wasted the first when he headed wide from inside the six-yard box after Junior Stanislas did well to cut back Francis’ deep cross. The second opportunity fell to Gosling, who scooped over the bar from 12 yards after King had outpaced Robert Huth and rolled the ball perfectly into the midfielder’s path.Norwich’s Alex Tettey punishes Southampton and Victor Wanyama Read moreIn an open and entertaining game Vardy could have put Leicester ahead in between those two moments. Leonardo Ulloa’s miscued effort rolled into his path and Vardy’s instinctive shot hit the inside of the post and bounced to safety. Vardy, to his credit, kept coming back for more and it was his low curling shot that forced Boruc into the save that led to Morgan, no more than four yards out, volleying a Christian Fuchs corner over.Then came that contentious penalty decision. Running on to Danny Drinkwater’s measured pass, Vardy looked to be clear but just as he entered the area Francis made the tackle that Marriner penalised so harshly .Howe, who described this point as a “huge result” for Bournemouth, felt the referee got it wrong. “Simon has got a difficult job there, Vardy is goalside of him, going towards the goal at full pace,” he said. “But Simon has come from the side and got a clear touch on the ball, timed it superbly and it’s not a penalty or a free-kick. It was a difficult one for the ref because he’s the other side of the pitch.”

Laurent Koscielny tap-in gives Arsenal win against Newcastle United
~~AUTHOR~~
Amy Lawrence
~CONTENTS~
Back in the height of summer when Petr Cech made his move across London, it was games as ragged and rickety as this that John Terry had in mind when he suggested the goalkeeper could be worth 12-15 points a season to Arsenal.Arsène Wenger’s team were below par, the radar was off, the fatigue had set in, and they came up against a Newcastle team who made more than enough chances to upset the league leaders. Cech dealt with assurance with Newcastle’s best efforts, which gave Arsenal the platform to eke out a win. Earning the points required resilience and the capacity to dig deep into their energy reserves. It was appropriate, perhaps, that the matchwinner was Laurent Koscielny, restored to the starting lineup after a much-needed breather.Arsenal 1-0 Newcastle United: Premier League – as it happened Read moreIt was indicative of how this game went that Wenger confessed he felt for his opponents. “Honestly I am long enough in football to know if you are in Newcastle’s place you feel sorry for them because they played very well,” he said. “I know also when you are capable to win and you haven’t played well it shows a mental aspect of your team that is very important.”It left Steve McClaren ruing the outcome when he felt his players had earned the right to take something with them on the journey north. “I’m scratching my head as to how we got nothing from that game,” he said. “Not many teams will come here and do that to Arsenal without getting something.“We were aggressive, kept control, created chances. I couldn’t fault what we tried to do. It was the complete performance without getting a result. It’s about putting the ball in the back of the net which is why they have the points and we don’t.”Asked if the answer to his head scratching could take the form of a giant 33-year-old goalkeeper, McClaren did not disagree. “Goalkeepers win you matches and he certainly won that game,” he said.There were two particularly influential stops. In the first half Cech was alert to parry away Giorginio Wijnaldum’s firm shot, and tidy up when Jack Colback followed up. At the start of the second half Aaron Ramsey ceded possession and the game opened up once again for the visitors. Ayoze Pérez dinked a perfect pass for Wijnaldum. Cech spread himself to smother superbly.His interventions were hugely important on a day when Arsenal struggled to find their fluency. One of the perils of the festive football calendar is the likelihood of busy players looking as if they barely know if they are coming or going. There were leggy performances, lapses of concentration, and off-key passes scattered liberally across the drenched Emirates pitch.Wenger watched on from his dugout, quietly frustrated that his team were not functioning properly. Mesut Özil’s touch and movement were typically deft, but those around him strained to reach his level. The energy levels improved in the second half as the game opened up and both teams became more cavalier and increasingly desperate in their search for a goal.Newcastle came close as Aleksandar Mitrovic and Chancel Mbemba threatened. Arsenal perked up when Olivier Giroud flashed a header across goal, and then Özil squeezed a brilliant pass towards Ramsey, whose shot was too tame to test Rob Elliot.In need of some inspiration, someone to take a risk or try something to force the issue, Koscielny stepped up to deliver in the 72nd minute. Giroud won headers in the box not once but twice after Özil floated in a corner. Koscielny was alive to sneak in at the far post to plant a shot past Elliot.Wenger was more than satisfied with the outcome as an example they may need to draw on as the season wears on. “Not to drop points when you play like we did today is very important. It helps the team – the memory of having done that before and winning the game helps you to hang on sometimes.”Trying to look at the bigger picture, he was in no mood to read too much into this match in terms of the title challenge. “It’s too early. We have 42 points, let’s be realistic.“Let’s focus that we are in a strong position. We have given a lot over Christmas. At the end of the day how many points have you made in four games? We knew nine points would be acceptable, 10 ideal.” He made the point that only Manchester City managed 10 points last season. And they did not go on to win the Premier League.Wenger and McClaren were quiet about any potential business to strengthen their squads over January but admitted they are hard at work to bolster their options. The intensity of four festive games over, there is still not much time to pause for a moment, regroup, and go again.

Norwich’s Alex Tettey punishes Southampton and Victor Wanyama
~~AUTHOR~~
Paul Doyle
~CONTENTS~
Ronald Koeman accused Sadio Mané and Victor Wanyama of “lacking focus” and letting the club down as Saints slid further down the table with a fourth consecutive away defeat. The Southampton manager was furious that he had to rearrange his game plan two hours before kick-off at Carrow Road because Mané turned up late for a team meeting, and Wanyama caused further disruption by getting sent off when the score was 0-0. Four minutes later Alex Tettey scored the winning goal for Norwich. Koeman said he will speak to the Southampton board about how to punish Mané and Wanyama.Koeman was particularly angry with Mané because he had warned the player about his attitude on Thursday, having noticed that the Senegalese forward appeared distracted in training. Koeman claimed he did not know whether the transfer speculation linking Mané with a January move to Manchester United was to blame.“My message to Sadio was that I think he wasn’t really focused and concentrated,” said Koeman. “He was not doing things in the training session how I like football players to do them.”That context, and the fact that Southampton’s chairman, Ralph Krueger, gave the whole squad a speech on New Year’s Day in which he emphasised the values they need to uphold, made Koeman all the more vexed with the player’s late arrival for the matchday meeting.“Sadio was in [the team] but we have rules and he was doing a big mistake because he came late and that’s impossible,” said Koeman. “I don’t understand players who come late, and everybody knows we have a sanction.”Mané knows it especially well, as he was dropped last February for a similar offence before a home match against Liverpool. “You have to make changes in the teams, in the set pieces, in everything,” said Koeman.Koeman was also aggrieved by the behaviour of Wanyama, another player linked with a transfer away, with Tottenham Hotspur and Arsenal among the Kenyan’s admirers. Wanyama was booked in the first half here for a crunching late tackle on Nathan Redmond and was sent off in the 72nd minute for another ugly tackle, this time on Vadis Odjidja-Ofoe.“A player with his experience needs to know if you have a yellow already you can’t do that,” said Koeman. “You have a responsibility to the fans, the team-mates, the board, the technical staff – losing is part of the job but sometimes we do it to ourselves. This is very painful. I will talk to the board and the players, I’m angry about what happened.”In addition to indiscipline, Southampton were undone here by wayward finishing. Even without Mané and their injured top scorer, Graziano Pellè, they created enough chances to take the lead. Shane Long pestered the home defence but missed several opportunities, most blatantly in the first half when he collected a pass from Cuco Martina before taking too many touches and allowing the Norwich goalkeeper Declan Rudd to smother his shot.Virgil van Dijk twice headed wide from corners in the first-half and Jordy Clasie brought a good save from Rudd with a curling shot from 25 yards. But Norwich also had chances in the first period after a stuttering start. Jonny Howson hit a bobbling shot wide from 12 yards after dispossessing José Fonte.Then, in the 21st minute, Van Dijk coughed up the ball to allow Wes Hoolahan to lead a counterattack, which ended with Howson trying to set up a tap-in for Russell Martin at the back post but misdirecting his pass. Howson provided a far better cross just before the break – Dieumerci Mbokani stretched to meet it but poked the ball just wide from eight yards.The second half was heading for a stalemate until Alex Neil made a bold change, replacing Redmond with Odjida-Ofoe around the hour. That move soon paid off but not before Dusan Tadic missed another good chance for the visitors. Moments later Odjida-Ofoe was caught late by Wanyama, who walked. The Belgian then teed up Tettey, who put on a free finishing lesson for Southampton by cracking a perfect shot into the top corner from the edge of the area.Koeman introduced Mané but it was too late.

Andy Carroll delivers knockout blow for West Ham against Liverpool

~CONTENTS~
West Ham United 2-0 Liverpool: Premier League – as it happened Read moreJürgen Klopp has brought much to Liverpool since becoming the manager but the one thing the German still cannot achieve is momentum. His team arrived here looking for a third straight victory but instead lost for a second time in four games, with the pain for those who filled the away end intensified by the identity of the man who delivered the killer blow.Andy Carroll has waited three years to score against his former club, making no secret of his frustration at not succeeding at Anfield having arrived there for £35m in January 2011, and he finally delivered. It was classic Carroll, a soaring, expertly directed header that had the ball nestling in the far corner of the net. The No9’s revenge followed another fine header from Michail Antonio after 10 minutes, and the win not only moved West Ham ahead of Liverpool into sixth but also completed a league double over the Merseyside club for the first time in 52 years having triumphed at Anfield in August.West Ham’s performance was full of energy, endeavour and no little skill, and for Klopp there was no hiding his fury with his side at their failure to build on victories over Leicester City and Sunderland and instead revert to the lacklustre, sloppy outfit who were beaten 3-0 at Watford before Christmas.The “soft German” was hard on his players this time. “It was not enough from my team and I’m really angry because we could have got more because everybody could see in the moments we play football what could happen,” Klopp said. “We have to again accept that we didn’t play like we should.”Klopp went on to say Liverpool “always had the ball”, which while stretching it was not completely barmy given they had 65% of possession. As he intimated, Liverpool showed flashes of their capabilities either side of the interval when they threatened with slick, purposeful play, most notably via Emre Can’s shot in first-half stoppage time that rattled the bar. But all too often, and not for the first time this season, their passing broke down and they lacked penetration.Operating again as a lone forward Christian Benteke delivered another display that makes Liverpool’s decision to spend £32.5m on the 25-year-old in the summer appear a mistake. The Belgian was too often static and did little or nothing when presented with a chance to strike, most notably early on in the second-half, and with the score 1-0 to West Ham, when he wafted half-heartedly at Alberto Moreno’s cross.The comparison with Carroll was stark. The 26-year-old was a constant nuisance to Liverpool’s back four with his aggressive, muscular approach and he put them to the sword on 55 minutes, running on to Mark Noble’s cross and, having got a jump on Nathaniel Clyne, sending the ball past a rooted Simon Mignolet for his third goal of the season. Another header shortly after forced Mignolet into a save and, overall, this was a fine afternoon for a player deemed not good enough for Liverpool having become, and remaining ahead of Benteke, their most expensive signing to remind his former employers of what they let go.Slaven Bilic praised Carroll’s all-round contribution. “Andy was brilliant, not just because of the goal but for his performance,” said the West Ham manager. “Now he is fit and it is all about him. Is he going to look after himself, work hard, maintain his position or to even make it better?”      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Andy Carroll rises highest to head home. Photograph: Tom Jenkins for the ObserverThere were other standout performers in claret and blue, such as James Collins and Manuel Lanzini, who almost scored with a wickedly swerving shot that hit the post before he was substituted with what appears to be a reoccurrence of a thigh injury and is likely to be out for up to six weeks.Dimitri Payet came on as a second-half substitute having been out of action for two months with an ankle injury. The Frenchman, so brilliant following his arrival from Marseille in the summer, could well end up taking Antonio’s starting place, although the 25-year-old may take some shifting having scored his second goal in successive games.It summed up West Ham’s show of desire and ruthlessness that the opener came via a counterattack that started with Antonio winning the ball from Moreno by his own area before sprinting up the pitch to meet Enner Valencia’s cross.“The situation with Alberto was a foul but we reacted not right. We have to avoid this cross,” said Klopp, who by the end was watching proceedings from underneath his hood on what was a wet and grey afternoon in east London. The weather summed up his mood as well as the bleakness of Liverpool’s top-four hopes.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   West Ham’s Michail Antonio celebrates after opening the scoring.

Dundee come from behind to leave neighbours Dundee United rock bottom
~CONTENTS~
Dundee piled more misery on Dundee United with victory against 10 men at Dens Park. They came from behind after Kane Hemmings scored four minutes before half-time and Nick Ross just after the hour to cancel out Blair Spittal’s 15th-minute opener from a free-kick.The result left Mixu Paatelainen’s team stranded at the foot of the table and staring relegation in the face. United’s frustration boiled over when the midfielder Guy Demel was sent off with seven minutes remaining for a second yellow card.United handed a debut to the Japanese goalkeeper Eiji Kawashima, who had completed his move to Tannadice earlier in the week. For the hosts, the striker Greg Stewart was suspended so Hemmings led the line on his own.It was a brisk start and United almost gifted their rivals an early opener when Gavin Gunning’s short backpass was intercepted by Hemmings – but Kawashima was quick off his line to clear. The ball went only as far as Gary Harkins, whose shot from 20 yards was held by the goalkeeper.Dundee suffered a double setback when their captain, James McPake, was carried off after a 10th-minute collision with John Rankin and replaced in central defence by Kostadin Gadzhalov. The referee, Kevin Clancy, awarded the free-kick against McPake and Spittal sent a glorious effort into the top-right corner of Scott Bain’s goal.The Tangerines sought to add to their lead and Billy McKay had a shot saved by Bain before the on-loan Wigan forward shot over.Dundee threatened in the 27th minute after Nicky Low’s long pass picked out the onrushing Hemmings inside the box. The striker turned and unleashed an effort at goal but again Kawashima was equal to the task. At the other end, John Rankin’s right-foot volley brought out a brilliant save from Bain. However, just before the break Hemmings equalised. Kawashima could only punch Low’s free-kick and Hemmings was on hand to volley into the net from six yards.The second-half started with Spittal trying his luck with a free-kick that flew wide. Dundee got the winner when Ross turned 25 yards from goal and hit a left-foot shot that took a deflection off Sean Dillon, wrong-footed Kawashima and found the net. A few minutes later, Paul McGowan drove right through the United defence but his shot was touched wide by Kawashima.  The 100 best footballers in the world 2015 – interactive Read more

Ninkovic A-League double hauls Sydney back for draw against City
~CONTENTS~
Milos Ninkovic scored a fine double to spare Sydney FC’s blushes in a madcap 2-2 A-League draw with an under-strength Melbourne City. Twice the Sky Blues came from behind at AAMI Park on Saturday night and twice Filip Holosko was at the assist for Ninkovic.A-League referee Williams apologises for gaffes in Wanderers stalemate Read moreThe Serbian’s goals ensured the spoils would be shared after City stole the lead against the run of play. Aaron Hughes looked out of touch and lucky to be on the pitch before heading City into the lead after 37 minutes. Ninkovic restored parity, but City’s golden-boot leader Bruno Fornaroli produced his 11th goal of the season for 2-1.Ninkovic made it 2-2 and substitute Shane Smeltz might have grabbed it at the death, only to volley over. City couldn’t have complained after producing their poorest start of the season. Talismanic Socceroo Aaron Mooy (ribs) was one of five exclusions, along with Erik Paartalu (soreness) and Ivan Franjic (quad).The mass-change affected City, who began like a team of park footballers. Sydney ran rampant, denied only by a combination of last-ditch defending, wayward shooting and City gloveman Thomas Sorensen. Hughes was playing with none of the experience from his 455 English Premier League matches, twice misjudging the ball in flight to leave his team terribly exposed.A fired-up Jacob Melling unleashed a tackle on George Blackwood worthy of a Sky Blue penalty, but it was overlooked by referee Strebre Delovski. When Michael Zullo appeared at the half-way line shortly after it seemed Hughes or Matt Millar would pay for their poor starts, but instead debutant midfielder Ali Eyigun was withdrawn.Then City produced a sucker punch, with Hughes heading home Harry Novillo’s accurate corner. The Sky Blues responded after the break, with Ninkovic producing the match’s best goal. The 31-year-old diverted Holosko’s cross past Sorensen with the inside of his heel, wheeling away in delight with the equaliser.City looked there for the taking but Novillo drove them forward once more, finding the Uruguayan on the hour mark. Fornaroli was barely a factor in the match for the opening hour but climbed high to power a header past Vedran Janjetovic. Sydney coach Graham Arnold’s blushes were spared with 12 minutes remaining, when Alex Gersbach’s cross found Holosko to head back for Ninkovic. The equaliser was tough for City but worse could yet be to come, with Jacob Melling hobbling from the ground with a suspected knee injury.City boss John van ’t Schip said he was pleased with his side’s response after a poor start, which he credited to the late withdrawals of Mooy and Paartalu. “We had so many changes, we didn’t even practice this week with this team because (their injuries) came up this morning,” he said. “The reaction was positive, they showed very good character.”Arnold said after the first half-hour, it was two points thrown away. “We had chance after chance after chance,” he said. “If you don’t take your chances, you get punished.”

Transfer window wishlists: who Premier League fans want to sign this winter
~~AUTHOR~~
Observer fans' network
~CONTENTS~
ArsenalThe need for defensive midfield cover for Francis Coquelin is obvious: Leicester’s Kanté has been impressive, and Bender and Krychowiak are among the rumour mill’s usual suspects. But with competition for that sort of talent fierce and availability limited, it’s hard to imagine Wenger pulling off a single transfer coup this month. If we’re fantasising, though, we also need a long-term replacement for Mertesacker – controversial, maybe, but I’d quite fancy the bite that someone like Ryan Shawcross could bring to our docile crew – and there’s still a gaping hole in our attacking options. I’m worried, though, that the current crop of megabucks big-hitters (Benzema, Cavani, Higuaín or even Zlatan) would lack real motivation. Bernard Azulay @GoonersDiaryAston VillaEvery team since football was invented needs a spine of experienced pros. We need six of them. As it looks like we need to be planning for the Championship, I expect we’ll soon be seeing the likes of Joey Barton, Ian Harte and that massive striker from Wimbledon in claret and blue. Looking back, it’s depressing that every one of Watford and Leicester’s players were available to us in July. Some “transfer committee”. Jonathan Pritchard Observer readerPremier League fans’ half-time verdict part 1: Arsenal to Manchester United Read moreBournemouthHere are three I’d fancy: Lyon striker Alexandre Lacazette (if only we had £21m to spend…); Hull’s Michael Dawson to give us more defensive strength and competition for Tommy Elphick and Steve Cook; and Bolton’s Zach Clough. He’s one for the future – a youngster with amazing dribbling ability. He’s only going to get better. Peter Bell @PeterBell19Crystal PalaceWe’re really light on fit and prolific strikers – it feels like that will be the priority, with Sporting Lisbon’s Islam Slimani among the obvious options. But being greedy (given the existing strength on the bench) we could do with another centre-back to cover Dann and Delaney, too. Chris Waters @clapham_grandChelseaWhat do we need? Some players with a bit of integrity. Just in footballing terms, though, we need another striker desperately – and given that the big players probably won’t be available until the summer, I’d go for Charlie Austin. I’d also buy Juan Mata back: with Mourinho nailed on to get the United job, I think he’d love to come home. Paul Pogba would be nice – unlikely, but nice – and the defence need help. The John Stones deal is probably dead now, but I’d give it a go just to upset Roberto Martínez. Trizia Fiorellino ChelseaSupportersGroup.netEvertonWe nearly signed Dynamo Kyiv’s Andriy Yarmolenko in the summer after agreeing the £15m buy-out clause. I’d love it to happen but with Dynamo still in the Champions League it seems unlikely before the close season. Joel Robles is not the long-term replacement we need for Tim Howard. I’d like to see Jack Butland arrive at Everton, and I’d like another striker as cover for Lukaku. Steve Jones @bluekippercomLeicesterHere’s our dilemma now: stick or twist? Team spirit is a big part of our success story and adding too many new faces could upset the apple cart. I think we could do with some more defensive quality, though, and a deal for Milan’s Nigel de Jong seems to be happening. I think it would also serve us well to sign another striker. I’m confident in the abilities of Okazaki, Ulloa and Kramaric, but it wouldn’t hurt to have a better option in case Vardy gets injured or suspended. Porto’s Vincent Aboubakar might be an optimistic shout… Chris Whiting @ChrisRWhitingLiverpoolDeep breath: we need a keeper (Jack Butland would be great), a ball-playing centre-half, a defensive midfielder (Kanté from Leicester?) and a striker. Origi is still learning, Ings is injured, Benteke isn’t delivering on a consistent basis yet, and then there’s Sturridge. We clearly need someone else this month – and Borussia Dortmund’s Germany international Marco Reus is the obvious choice. Steph Jones Observer readerManchester CityBefore we make any signings we should recall Jason Denayer from his loan at Galatasaray and parachute him straight back into the first team squad ahead of Mangala. Demichelis should then be moved on (not without thanks, though), and we should look for a new striker to fill the vacancy in our squad. Lloyd Scragg @Lloyd_ScraggManchester UnitedVan Gaal obviously needs a couple of world class players to try to turn this around – but which top player would want to come here at the moment? I would love to see Gareth Bale, Antoine Griezmann and John Stones arrive – Bale would give us that speed up front that we are clearly missing. And maybe we could swap Rooney and Fellaini for Stones… Shaun O’Donnell Observer readerNewcastleSo then … We need a left-back (selling Davide Santon was a huge mistake), a centre-half, a playmaker in the Yohan Cabaye mould and a proven scorer. The shame is that under our current recruitment policy, it’s unlikely that any new signings will have the Premier League experience we desperately need. I’d love to bring in anyone with a bit of fighting spirit and leadership – a player like free agent Kevin Nolan, for instance… Richard & David Holmes Observer readersNorwichA shiny new centre-back – possibly a pair – is an absolute must if we are to survive. We’re paying the price for not sorting this out in the summer. We won’t attract big names but someone like Curtis Davies from Hull would be an improvement. And a proven top-flight goalscorer would be nice – but probably out of our financial reach. Gary Gowers NorwichCity.MyFootballWriter.comPremier League fans’ half-time verdict part 2: Newcastle to West Ham Read moreSouthamptonWe need another striker to give Pellè a bit of help, but most of all, a forward with pace. We look really one-dimensional these days, so someone other than Mané who can take players on and produce something out of nothing would be ideal. And another centre-back wouldn’t go amiss either, if only so Steven Caulker can be packed off back from whence he came. How he’s got an England cap… Steve Grant @SteveGrant1983StokeThe only piece of the jigsaw missing at the moment is a regular scorer. The name that stands out to me is Saido Berahino. He’s the type of player we need to go after, and we need to try to persuade him that we can offer much more than Tottenham. Add a firing Berahino to our diamond trio of Arnautovic, Bojan and Shaqiri and the world is really our oyster… Rob Holloway Observer readerSunderlandI have seen a lot of (big) money wasted in January windows – Alfred N’Diaye, Danny Graham, Radoslav Prica – so I’ve no idea what will happen. We certainly need defensive options, and a top-class centre-forward – but I’m sure there are another ten clubs who feel the same. As usual, we will probably borrow someone from the big boys. Pete Sixsmith SalutSunderland.comSwanseaWe desperately need a striker. Bafétimbi Gomis just isn’t up to the job, and his commitment has been under question for the majority of the time he’s been here. A decent striker (and a decent manager) should see us clear of the bottom three. Kevin Elphick Swansea.VitalFootball.co.ukTottenhamWe have good cover in most positions. Trippier and Davies would be regular starters at a lot of clubs and Wimmer looks a dependable centre-back. There is a lot of quality choice in midfield. But we have only Kane as an out-and-out striker – clearly we need cover here. And a fast, intelligent winger would be a real bonus. Dave Mason Observer readerWatfordWe’ve been relatively lucky with injuries – Watson and Britos have more than adequately stood in for Behrami and Prödl – but most obviously an injury to either of the front two might leave us exposed. Emmanuel Adebayor has been mentioned in dispatches, which even as an unsubstantiated rumour is a bizarre upgrade given where we were a few years ago. Flores has also suggested that some “proper” wingers might give us the potency to vary our approach still further, and I’m not going to argue… Matt Rowson bhappy.org.ukWest BromThere’s no point asking a West Brom fan who we should we sign in January – our chairman is Jeremy Peace … we rarely spend in the winter window. But if we sell Berahino I hope we add some quality pace and trickery, as the manager clearly doesn’t rate Gnabry and McManaman. Richard Jefferson @richbaggieWest HamWe could do with a prolific striker, someone like Everton’s Lukaku or Watford’s Ighalo. There are still doubts about Andy Carroll’s fitness and suitability for a Bilic side and Diafra Sakho, while working hard, is currently injured and has not maintained last season’s prolific form. Maybe, too, some more cover for the full-backs. Pete May HammersInTheHeart.blogspot.co.uk

Henrique gets Brisbane Roar to top of A-League table with win over Glory
~CONTENTS~
Olyroos striker Jamie Maclaren has punished his former side to help Brisbane Roar to the top of the A-League table after a nervy 2-1 home victory over Perth Glory. In his last appearance before this month’s Olympic qualifying tournament in Qatar, Maclaren produced his seventh goal of the season early in the second half to put the Roar on track for their fourth straight win.Roy O'Donovan says victim of his A-League headbutt 'deserves an Oscar' Read moreSuper-sub Henrique appeared to seal the match soon after and steal top spot from Western Sydney Wanderers at the halfway point of the season, in front of 17,696 fans at Suncorp Stadium. Making it worse for the Glory, coach Kenny Lowe freely admitted he was “crying out” for a reliable centre-forward after his side squandered several close-range chances.Lowe could only applaud Maclaren, who was hemmed in behind Irishman Andy Keogh last season, for making the most of his move east. “Fair play to the kid he’s a good footballer,” he said. “I think sometimes young lads want it too quick but we had Andy Keogh there, it was difficult for him.”However Maclaren, who jets off to Qatar this week for the Olympic qualifying tournament, wasn’t about to offer his old coach any post-match condolences. “I approached it a bit different to any other fixture because it was my old club and there was a lot of history behind it,” he said. “But that’s forgotten about and I wanted to go out an do well for the new club.”But Perth made them work hard all the way to the final whistle with substitute Hagi Gligor scoring with his first touch in the 70th minute from a Diego Castro cut back. The Glory had their chances in the dying minutes as Brisbane keeper Jamie Young denied Josh Risdon before captain Jade North cleared a shot off the line, In a highly-entertaining encounter, it was Young who stood tallest for the Roar with more than 10 saves. Glory keeper Ante Covic put in his own fine shift, ensuring a scoreless deadlock at halftime, especially through his full-stretch dive to deny a booming Thomas Broich strike.Needing victory to move to the top of the table, the Roar started the encounter brightly to take complete control as the Glory chose to sit back and stay compact, even with the ball. But while the home side dominated the play with their probing passing game to have more first-half opportunities, it was Perth who enjoyed the better chances.Only a fine diving save by Young denied a strong angled shot by Harold in the 29th minute before defender Michael Thwaite misjudged a perfect cross from Risdon with only Young to beat. It was Maclaren, who left Perth in the off-season after a lack of opportunities, who lit up the helter-skelter second half with his superb finish to a classy team move seven minutes into the second half.Henrique was only on the park for four minutes before he made it 2-0 but Gligor forced his way onto the scorer’s sheet even more immediately to set up the tense finish. Lowe believed his ninth-placed side deserved a point. “It’s just frustrating when you put that much effort and endeavour,” he said. “It’s a bit of a heart-ache when you deserve it. “But such is life. A little bit of pain never hurt anybody. We just have to be better with finishing.”

Steven Gerrard is planning a move into coaching when he ends his playing career, most likely later this year, and has hinted at a future with Liverpool.Gerrard left Anfield in the summer, moving to Major League Soccer and the LA Galaxy, but has been back on Merseyside during the MLS close season and taking part in Jürgen Klopp’s training sessions.The former England captain told the Daily Telegraph: “I’m not 100% sure but I think it will probably be my last year as a player.”Jürgen Klopp: ‘I don’t want to bring Daniel Sturridge back too soon’ Read moreHe added: “I have had a chat with Klopp. I haven’t had an offer as such but the club have let me know they are keen for me to come back but there hasn’t been a conversation where they have said: ‘We want you to do this, we want you to do that.’“They have welcomed me back in. I am always going to be biased towards Liverpool and the FA and basically when I am back home I am going to carry on with my punditry work and try and move around clubs and gain more experience, going to watch managers and learning more. I am basically available from November, December 2016. Everyone in the football world will know I am available and hopefully I will be 75 per cent into my coaching badges.”Gerrard said he regretted not beginning work towards his badges earlier in his playing career and urged the Football Association to do more to engage its most experienced players in order to keep them in the game.“I have regrets I didn’t start my coaching badges at 21-22,” he said. “All that time wasted in hotels as an England player when I’ve been bored and was watching The Office and The Sopranos. I wish I’d done my CBA [coaching] licence then, so I’d be doing my pro-licence now. I know many players get to the end of their careers, get handed a thick C licence pack and say, ‘Nah, I’m not doing that.’ That’s 70-80 caps and 600 career appearances and he is just going ‘Nah’. He could have had it done.“I had a meeting with the FA and said these players that are earning a certain amount of caps – don’t let them go away from the game. Do more to keep them involved.”

Remember how far Newcastle Jets have come, says coach Scott Miller
~CONTENTS~
Newcastle coach Scott Miller has challenged anyone laying “unwarranted criticism” on his team to remember the depths from which they have come.The eighth-placed Jets lost their ninth consecutive A-League match at home to Melbourne Victory on Sunday, in a blow to a side that started the season so promisingly.Melbourne Victory break Hunter Stadium A-League hoodoo in Jets win Read moreA lack of resources available to the FFA-owned club have not made things easy, especially given injuries have forced constant rotation of a squad that had little depth to start with.Another dagger has been the absence of Brazilian playmaker Leonardo, who has managed only seven appearances because of a recurring knee injury, while Serbian striker Milos Trifunovic has recently struggled in front of goal.But while ruing his team had not “rewarded themselves” against Victory, Miller observed a lack of understanding from some outside quarters of how much the club as a whole has achieved since last season’s wooden spoon during the ill-fated Nathan Tinkler era.“I think we’ve got some unwarranted criticism throughout the year overall,” Miller said.“From where the club was to where it is now is a great improvement, and total respect to the playing group for their responsibility and effort so far.“It’s not about being disappointed, it’s about being focused on achieving something here this year that derives from stability, but also maximising the opportunity and over-achieving. There’s been a balance of the two of late ... and that’s a team in rebuild.”Miller was loath to address some unflattering statistics, including a 469-minute goalless stretch across a club-record five matches – only one match less than the now-defunct New Zealand Knights’ all-time record of six back in 2006.A-League talking points: the January transfer window brings fresh hope Read more“Stats are there for journalism, and to point out failure or achievements,” he said. “We look at the facts, and we look at improving a team individually and technically. That’s our focus, not stats.“Because the tide will turn – fortunately for Melbourne [Victory], their tide turned, and we were the ones that allowed them to do so.”Trifunovic has four goals to his name this season, but has not found the back of the net in his last six showings.It was a drought Miller said had more to do with the quality of service than a fault of his own or lack of confidence.“He’s not going to be a Mark Bridge ie last week, taking on Daniel Mullen inside the box,” he said.“It’s a one-touch finish either with his head or from crosses. We’re failing to give him the right service, so it’s not about his confidence.”Asked if Trifunovic ever felt frustrated by the lack of service, Miller replied: “It’s not his job to be frustrated, it’s his job to score.”

Gary Neville says he wants to stay on as Valencia manager
~~AUTHOR~~
Sid Lowe
~CONTENTS~
Gary Neville insisted after Sunday’s 2-2 draw with Real Madrid he wants to continue as Valencia manager beyond the end of the season when his contract expires, having previously said management is not his long-term goal. Speaking after his team had come back from 1-0 and 2-1 down to draw 2-2 with Real Madrid, Neville said that he wants to continue at the club that he joined last month on a six month contract.Neville had made no commitment to continue before and had hinted that this was a temporary post, repeatedly referring to his role at the Spanish club as a short-term one and leading most in Valencia to believe that he would walk away in the summer. On Sunday in an interview with Sky Sports, he said: “I’m not going to say where I want to end up, and it isn’t in management or head coaching, so I want to be clear about that.”Gary Neville’s Valencia hold Real Madrid to thrilling draw Read moreBut last night he said for the first time he intends to carry on at Mestalla, if given the opportunity. “I was talking about 15 or 20 years’ time! I don’t want to be just a coach for six months. I hope I am here beyond six months but I have to prove myself.”Valencia have won just once in six games, against third-tier Barakaldo in the Copa del Rey, but there are clear signs of improvement and this game will go some way to proving that the manager can bring about improvement, even if the task of returning to the Champions League, the club’s target, remains a huge one – they are 13 points off fourth place.Neville described the draw against Real as a fantastic performance, the best from his team since he took over. He was also quick to praise his players, insisting: “The best thing is they are all young and they are so talented it’s untrue, they really are. There are some fantastic players in the changing room.”It is a rather different story for Rafa Benítez, whose position remains in doubt. Before the game he was asked if he felt a defeat would cost him his post. Afterwards, he was asked if the draw might do so, as they had passed up another opportunity to close the gap on Barcelona and Atlético Madrid, he said: “That’s if we only look at the result; this performance deserves more praise than criticism.” “We played a great game. We saw a great team that with ten players stood up to be counted and until the end had a chance to win.”“I can’t avoid people speculating [about my future]. But I can make sure that the team works the way it did today.”

Louis van Gaal: Manchester United spurred by anger of December downfall
~~AUTHOR~~
Jamie Jackson
~CONTENTS~
Anger has been the prevailing emotion of Louis van Gaal and his players during their barren six-week run with no victory. The manager revealed the feeling in the dressing room as Manchester United slid down the table and were knocked out of the Champions League by Wolfsburg in a December that was the poorest in the club’s 138-year history.This 2-1 win against Swansea City finally turned the mood to joy and Van Gaal could also speak of hopeful liftoff into 2016 for Wayne Rooney, whose sublime back-heeled winner broke the captain’s own two-month club scoring drought and placed him ahead of Denis Law on 238 United goals – and a clear second behind Alan Shearer in the Premier League stakes with 188 goals.Louis van Gaal: entertaining the media, if not Manchester United’s fans | Barry Glendenning Read more“They[the players] are very angry that we have lost so many games in a row,” Van Gaal said of the four-match streak that started with the defeat by Wolfsburg. “They are not used to that, I’m not used to that, losing four matches in a row. Never – and I have been in this profession for 25 years, so it’s unusual and they are angry, and want to change the situation.”Of Rooney, he said: “I hope that it can give a boost to him because the goal was fantastic. There was not so much space and still he ran to the first post and did it this way, so it was fantastic, and I am very happy for him.”The faultlines in this Vas Gaal squad remain, though. The first-half display was reminiscent of the rudderless days two years ago under David Moyes. Rooney may have waited since 3 November for an eighth goal of the season but he and Anthony Martial remain seriously starved of chances. The 20-year-old began the scoring, benefiting from space created by Rooney’s near-post run to head beyond Lukasz Fabianski from the excellent Ashley Young’s cross.It came just after the break, yet when Gylfi Sigurdsson equalised on 70 minutes United seemed certain to extend their winless sequence to a ninth outing. Van Gaal’s side had not scored twice without the benefit of an own goal or penalty for nearly three months, when Everton were beaten 3-0 on 17 October. This is scarcely credible, given the attacking heritage of the great teams of Sir Matt Busby and Sir Alex Ferguson.Anthony Martial and Wayne Rooney prove Manchester United’s ghostbusters | Paul Wilson Read moreVan Gaal lined up with three centre-backs, Chris Smalling, Daley Blind and Phil Jones, who was replaced at half-time because of a recurrence of his recent ankle injury. In front of the trio was a disjointed four-man midfield that featured Bastian Schweinsteiger on the left, with Martial and Juan Mata placed further ahead, behind Rooney.Van Gaal stated the system was a “risk” and so, too, had been the pressing mode employed against Chelsea on 28 December because of the “space behind us”.It is a quaint claim and will do nothing to pacify fans who believe the 64-year-old is betraying the club’s proud modus operandi of first looking always for the jugular of the opposition.Still, the welcome three points were attained via the class of Martial and Rooney. If they can hit form together there is hope for the rest of United’s campaign. Martial glided along the left, flipped the ball to his captain and, with a deft flick of his heel, Fabianski was beaten. Is this a sign of a burgeoning partnership? “I hope so,” Van Gaal said. “Now Martial is playing on the left side again, and we have tried that before also, and Wayne in the striker’s position. But we played in another shape, so there are other aspects – you cannot say that is the reason [both of them scored]. I have to say all the players do their utmost best and you can see that but still there is still space for improvement.”Swansea City are a place above the relegation zone and still have a caretaker manager in Alan Curtis. “I don’t think anything would surprise me,” said the Welshman, when asked if he might still be in charge in two months’ time. “It wouldn’t surprise me if somebody came in tomorrow as well. You prepare for both scenarios. You do what you can do.”If United had lost and other results gone against them they could have sunk to 10th in the Premier League. Instead, the manager and his squad can gaze upwards and note they are only two points from Tottenham Hotspur in the final Champions League place and nine behind the leaders, Arsenal, in this topsy-turvy season.It is the FA Cup third round next, when Sheffield United are the visitors to Old Trafford in the third round on Saturday. Then there is a midweek trip to Newcastle United followed by a Sunday visit to Anfield to take on Jürgen Klopp’s Liverpool.“Now the pressure is lowering, the performance shall be better every week,” said Van Gaal. Until the second half here, it could not have become much poorer.Man of the match Wayne Rooney (Manchester United)Louis van Gaal: entertaining the media, if not Manchester United’s fans | Barry Glendenning Read more

Arsène Wenger pleased Arsenal now have the experience to win ugly

Amy Lawrence
~CONTENTS~
Plan B. For so many years, that concept was lobbed at Arsène Wenger come times of trouble in accusing tones. Plan B was the thing that Arsenal did not have and, on the occasions when their passing game did not click, when their creativity was squeezed, when their fluency dried up, Plan B taunted them by its very absence.Laurent Koscielny tap-in gives Arsenal win against Newcastle United Read moreIn the last couple of matches Arsenal have needed something from the Plan B school. These were games three and four of the mini-series over Christmas and new year where tiredness, the lack of options to rotate because of injuries and a hint of knocked momentum inflicted by that 4-0 thumping at Southampton, meant Arsenal were not at their best.In both games the breakthrough came from a defender, whose determination to make a difference from a set piece paved the way for three precious points. After Gabriel powered in a header against Bournemouth Laurent Koscielny bounded into position to give Arsenal the edge over Newcastle.Transfer window wishlists: who Premier League fans want to sign this winter Read moreWenger is not the type naturally to love a game that depends on dredging up reserves of effort. But his satisfaction was obvious at the end of a hard-fought victory because of everything it told him about the spirit of his team.“You fight, not to concede a goal, not panic and wait for your chance. We were more questioned on that aspect than the way we play football so it is good sometimes to win like that. Watching Newcastle I was impressed by them,” noted Wenger. “I think a team has always a charisma. If you look at the team as a unit, it is like a person. From the vibes coming out you can sense if there is something in there or not.”He feels there is more in there now than with the younger teams he had in recent years. “In my job if you don’t believe in your team you are in a bad shape,” he says. “I think they are more experienced now. When we moved into the stadium here, on the day we could play everybody off the park but, when you had to dig deep, come out with your knowledge and your experience, it was a bit more difficult.”With the exception of Héctor Bellerín (aged 20) and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain (22) the average age of the rest of Arsenal’s starting XI against Newcastle was 29. They needed plenty of collective knowhow to withstand some exciting moments from Newcastle, who broke with verve at times, before finding their decisive goal.There was promising movement and a cluster of chances were created when the attacking trio of Moussa Sissoko, Georginio Wijnaldum and Ayoze Pérez roaming behind Aleksandar Mitrovic got into their stride. Newcastle have to cling to the positive signs but at some stage soon they need to add a ruthless edge.Steve McClaren put on a brave face afterwards but it was not easy to take another harsh example of how performances do not always get rewarded in the hard currency of Premier League points. “We just have got to keep performing like that and keep believing, even though we keep getting knock-backs, especially in the last three games,” he said.“I cannot fault the players or their attitudes. The last three games we have lost 1-0 and had good chances to score first but we’ve not. That is why we have lost them. If we had had Olivier Giroud, I think we would have comfortably won the game.“That’s the difference in football and everybody is always searching for that. Papiss Cissé, who is a goalscorer, is out for the next two or three months. We have got other goalscorers – we have just got to step to the plate and start scoring. Doing our job.”Newcastle are actively searching for striking reinforcements in the winter transfer window. “We have been working behind the scenes. We will do tirelessly,” added McClaren.Rather like Wenger – albeit in rather different circumstances – McClaren is counting on the spirit he likes the look of to carry his team in the right direction.Man of the match Petr Cech (Arsenal)

Stoke’s Mark Hughes ready to launch appeal over Geoff Cameron red card
~CONTENTS~
Mark Hughes believes Stoke City will appeal against Geoff Cameron’s red card as the manager prepares for Tuesday’s cup game against Liverpool. The midfielder was sent off in the 2-1 defeat at West Bromwich Albion for pushing Claudio Yacob in the back of the neck.Stoke host Jürgen Klopp’s side in the Capital One Cup semi-final, first leg, with Cameron facing a three-match ban if the decision is not overturned.Jonny Evans strikes injury-time West Brom winner to down in-form Stoke Read moreHughes said: “We’ll have a look at that and decide whether or not to appeal but I think it’s likely.“It was unfortunate. I thought Geoff has reacted to a late challenge on a leg he injured in the first half. It is understandable to a certain extent. We weren’t too happy with the reaction of the lad Yacob, to be perfectly honest. I thought he has gone down with the intention of maybe getting Geoff sent off and unfortunately for us that’s what he’s able to do.”Jonny Evans capitalised on Cameron’s exit when scoring in stoppage time to give the West Brom manager, Tony Pulis, a third straight win over his former club. Jonathan Walters had equalised two minutes before Cameron’s 83rd-minute dismissal to cancel out Stéphane Sessègnon’s opening strike.It was Sessègnon’s first goal since October 2014 whereas Evans opened his club account – which sent West Brom nine points clear of the Premier League’s bottom three – and earned praise from Pulis.“He’s been a great signing for us,” he said. His quality in possession is first class. He slows things down for us and is more than just a good defender.““We’ve played him at centre-half, left-back, in the centre of midfield - he’s done a good job in all of those. He just oozes class. He’s a top, top player.”

Manchester City aware Sergio Agüero holds key to title challenge
~~AUTHOR~~
Alan Smith
~CONTENTS~
Manchester City rarely do things the easy way. So often they need to be stung into action, floundering through games before pulling themselves back from the precipice. It was a familiar story here. A goal behind and searching inefficaciously for a first away win since 12 September, Manuel Pellegrini needed two old reliables, hitherto subdued, to ignite a title challenge that has lumbered rather than accelerated.City remain three points off the summit and, unequivocally, they have a few more gears to ascend. Concerns remain over their defensive capabilities without Vincent Kompany – Nicolás Otamendi and Eliaquim Mangala enduring a torrid runaround from Odion Ighalo, particularly in the first half – and some of their flair players could be accused of lacking the hunger for matches such as this. But they rose to the occasion just as a dank evening in Hertfordshire threatened to hit crisis point.In one sense City were lucky not to be more than a goal down when Yaya Touré exquisitely rifled home a corner with his left boot. While you can drool over his nonchalant genius, the Ivorian remains exasperating.Manuel Pellegrini says risk brought Manchester City reward at Watford Read moreHis impact up until then was minimal but two minutes later Sergio Agüero produced one of those breathtaking moments that few strikers are capable of. The Argentinian’s brilliant winner – he rose to direct home a Bacary Sagna cross from the right – was also a sure sign he is sharpening after his latest comeback from injury.This was the first time Agüero completed more than 70 minutes since late September and, while his feeble hamstrings remain in working order, City will be fancied to go all the way.Sagna said it could be a defining moment. “You can feel it on the pitch,” he said when asked about it being a turning point. “We feel confident because this is not the first time this has happened, that we have come back from being 1-0 down to win the game, and score at the end. But we have to be more careful, because that won’t happen every time. You have to take the game and create more chances before you concede.”Pellegrini was relieved to win away from home but played down his concern over a dismal accumulation of three points from the previous 18 on the road. “We were not worried. It’s not normal not to win for six [away] games but we were playing well.”The City manager was also buoyed by Agüero’s performance. The striker is still far from his best, lacking the burst of acceleration that we have so frequently seen him use to burst past defenders. His finishing instinct, though, looks undiminished and this winner took him to eight for the season despite spending less than 900 minutes on the field.“I think we know Kun [Agüero] needs three or four games to return to his top performance and for him the goal was important and hopefully he can go on,” Pellegrini added.Quique Sánchez Flores, the Watford manager, has had City as favourites for the title since the beginning and this defeat, having battled impressively only to succumb late on for the second time in six days, strengthened his opinion. “I thought so in the first leg [half of the season]. I keep thinking the same,” he said.Flores managed Agüero at Atlético Madrid and describes him and his City team-mate David Silva as the two best players he has worked with. Yet he made a salient point when saying Agüero’s injury troubles are likely to have slowed him down. “When you are injured, you losethe rhythm. But these kind of players have a good physique, they recuperate their shape.”After conceding in the final minute against Tottenham six days earlier to lose 2-1, it was unsurprising to see some of the home players sink to their knees at the end on Saturday. They can take confidence from another impressive performance, though. In previous games against perceived bigger sides, Watford sought to contain early on and play on the counter, but they started on the front foot here in an attempt to rough up Mangala and Otamendi. Ben Watson’s corner, deflected in by Aleksandar Kolarov, had given them a deserved lead before City’s smash and grab.Flores’s task now is to temper expectations. “We can manage it,” he insisted. “If you are able to enjoy this experience in the first year after seven years without playing in the Premier League, you are able to manage this situation and stay in the middle, off the bottom of the table.”Man of the match José Holebas (Watford)

Alex Neil hoping Mané-aided rise will help lure players to Norwich
~~AUTHOR~~
Paul Doyle
~CONTENTS~
For Norwich City, Sadio Mané’s late arrival could not have been better timed. By failing to show up punctually for a team meeting before this match, the Senegalese incurred the wrath of Ronald Koeman and the club’s mandatory punishment, immediate demotion to the bench. That development was warmly welcomed in the home dressing room.“I wasn’t aware of the disruption, just of the fact that he wasn’t in the starting lineup when we got the team,” said Alex Neil, who admitted that Mané’s omission gave his players a gee-up. “I don’t think there’s any question that we looked at it quite favourably because he’s one of their best players. We were delighted.”Norwich had already submitted their own lineup so Neil would not have been able to adjust it to take account of Mané’s absence even if he had wanted to but the extra confidence served his side well. Norwich were already feeling good about themselves, as victories against Manchester United and Aston Villa meant they came into this game with two wins in three matches and the relegation zone a comforting distance below them. Neil’s team are playing well but they have not got so high and mighty as to snub help from opponents and the alarming thing for Southampton supporters was that Mané was not the only visitor bearing gifts.Norwich’s Alex Tettey punishes Southampton and Victor Wanyama Read moreThe Saints’ finishing was everything Norwich could have wished for. Even without Mané, Koeman’s team created several clear chances but missed them all, with Shane Long and Dusan Tadic the most wasteful. Worse, Victor Wanyama’s tackling was as wild as his team-mates’ shooting and the midfielder got himself sent off in the 72nd minute by crunching into Vadis Odjidja-Ofoe, an unpardonable offence bearing in mind that he had been booked for doing something similar to Nathan Redmond in the first half. Within four minutes of Wanyama’s dismissal, Odjidja-Ofoe set up Alex Tettey to finish expertly from 16 yards.The win lifted Norwich to within a point of Southampton and closer to the position that Neil has been targeting since promotion. “I had aspirations of getting into that mid-table pack as quickly as we could,” he says, adding that being there now will help him lure players during this month’s transfer window: “We’re a more attractive proposition for players, they’ll see us as having a better chance of staying in the Premier League.”Transfer window wishlists: who Premier League fans want to sign this winter Read moreJanuary should prove an interesting month for Southampton, too. What will they do about Mané and Wanyama? Koeman must ascertain whether each player’s behaviour is a symptom of a desire to leave the club, with Manchester United interested in Mané, while Wanyama’s admirers include Tottenham Hotspur and Arsenal. The manager is not keen to sell either player and has made it clear that he would rather not have to spend each transfer window trying to offset the loss of key personnel.Koeman would prefer to concentrate on augmenting his squad, notably by signing a striker, even with the club’s top scorer, Graziano Pellè, returning from a knee injury soon. Sloppy finishing has been a recurring feature of Southampton’s run of one win in eight leagues games. That the win was a 4-0 thumping of Arsenal shows what this team are capable of and the standard below which they have fallen.Man of the match Ryan Bertrand (Southampton)

Andy Carroll comes good but Slaven Bilic warns him now is time to deliver
~~AUTHOR~~
Sachin Nakrani
~CONTENTS~
Given he is a qualified lawyer it did not come as a surprise to hear Slaven Bilic state a case after this match. The West Ham manager could simply and justifiably have basked in victory over Liverpool but instead he decided to make it clear to Andy Carroll following his first goal against his former club that now is the time for him to kick on with his career.“He [Carroll] looks really good and fit and it’s all about him now,” said Bilic. “Is he going to maintain and progress and look after himself, or is he going to go the other way? He has history in that and I’m not his dad, I can’t demand things from him. But I’m expecting that to be fair.”Andy Carroll delivers knockout blow for West Ham against Liverpool Read moreThose words were delivered to a small group of journalists in a corridor just outside the Upton Park press room and were near identical to those the Croat had delivered to the general media moments earlier. A clear and intentional doubling up of a message, and the hope, for not just Bilic but everyone associated with West Ham, is that their towering No9 will take it on board.For sure, there is the sense with Carroll that, at 26, he is reaching a crossroads in his career, one that has been dogged by controversies and injuries ever since he made his debut for Newcastle as a clean-shaven, short-haired 17-year-old in November 2006.The consensus is that he simply does not care and work hard enough, one articulated by Sam Allardyce, who managed Carroll at St James’ Park and brought him to West Ham after his £35m transfer to Liverpool had turned sour, in his recent autobiography. “He treats life too casually,” said Allardyce. “He also gets himself into situations off the pitch which a manager can do without – and so can he.”Allardyce went on to say that Carroll has the attributes to be “England’s regular centre-forward”, and with Euro 2016 looming now is the perfect time for a player with nine international caps to show that behind the negative headlines lies someone who can make a positive impact for club and country. He is certainly on the right track, having scored in successive Premier League games for the first time in 12 months, and after returning from a groin strain picked up just before Christmas, which was Carroll’s sixth injury of 2015.“To talk about the Euros is wrong for him,” said Bilic when the forward’s international credentials were put to the manager. “He’s got the quality but he has to show it on a longer scale. Now he’s got a chance.”Bilic went on to compare Carroll to his former Everton team-mate Duncan Ferguson, and there was certainly something Ferguson-esque about the way Carroll rose to power a header past Simon Mignolet. That goal followed Michail Antonio’s after 10 minutes – also a header – and sealed a deserved win for West Ham, one which extended their unbeaten run to seven games and completed a league double over Liverpool for the first time in 52 years.The only sour note for the hosts on a grey day in east London was Manuel Lanzini’s first-half withdrawal with what appears to be a recurrence of his recent thigh injury. The Argentinian will undergo scans on Monday and according to the club’s joint-chairman David Gold, could be out for up to six weeks.For Liverpool the problems run deeper. They came into this match on the back of successive victories and showed little determination to make it three out of three. Their attacking play was sloppy and lacklustre while defensively they were yet again undone by crosses, albeit two superbly delivered ones from Enner Valencia and the outstanding Mark Noble.Jürgen Klopp was furious with his players afterwards, accusing them of giving only “90 per cent” effort, and must now galvanise them for Tuesday’s Capital One Cup semi-final, first-leg tie at Stoke and Friday’s potentially tricky FA Cup tie at Exeter.“We are in a situation where we need to start playing football again,” said the Liverpool manager, who is close to completing his first signing with Red Star Belgrade midfielder Marko Grujic due to undergo a medical on Merseyside today. “That’s my responsibility.”Man of the match Mark Noble (West Ham United)

Jermain Defoe revels as lone ranger and gives Sunderland hope of better times
~~AUTHOR~~
Louise Taylor
~CONTENTS~
Sam Allardyce has always enjoyed challenging convention and positively revels in questioning consensus viewpoints but even the most independent thinkers can sometimes be swayed by received wisdoms.Influenced by stark warnings from his predecessors, Dick Advocaat and Gus Poyet, Sunderland’s manager duly bought into the notion that Jermain Defoe could not operate as a lone striker. With the team’s midfield too weak to cope with a 4-4-2 formation this dictated it was extremely difficult to fit the former England striker into his starting XI, and Defoe increasingly found himself warming the bench. Sunderland’s best-paid player had started to resemble the expensive piece of furniture that simply looks out of place in your sitting room and it seemed he could well depart Wearside this month.Jermain Defoe brace seals win for Sunderland to deepen Aston Villa woes Read moreThe time had come for Allardyce to discover his inner Kirstie Allsopp, smash down a metaphorical wall or two and offer Sunderland a makeover. Cue a new year transformation. With Defoe scoring twice – and having a third goal disallowed for a debatable offside – from his position at the apex of a 4-2-3-1 configuration Wearside survival hopes were revived and Aston Villa all but condemned to the Championship. By not only shifting Adam Johnson from a wide position to the hole behind Defoe but instructing him to stay as close to the striker as possible, Sunderland’s manager had fathomed out a winning formula.“Why has everybody consistently said Jermain can’t play up front on his own?” said Allardyce. “I’ve listened to everybody else but, in the end, I’ve decided to have a go with Jermain as a lone striker and it’s paid off. Adam Johnson’s ball control and quality can provide the service for Jermain to get between the full-backs and the centre-halves.The Dozen: the weekend's best Premier League photos Read more“We can’t just kick it up the middle anymore, that’s a waste of time. Maybe everybody has to realise Jermain’s there to provide for. That he’s the end product, not part of the build-up or a hold-up player. So we’re going to have to change our style, play through midfield, do better in wide positions and provide Jermain with cleverer balls. If we do that he’ll win us games.” A return of nine goals in the 12 matches Defoe has started this season would appear to endorse this stance.Much depends on Johnson. “I like him in the hole,” said Allardyce. “He gets more possession and can play the final ball we’re looking for.” Significantly the former England winger’s fine pass prefaced Defoe’s first goal, an angled left-footed shot expertly squeezed in at the near post.That made the score 2-1 and few were entirely confident that a less than convincing Sunderland would end a run of five straight defeats. Having dominated possession, Villa seemed unlucky to fall behind after Micah Richards deflected Patrick van Aanholt’s long-range shot beyond Brad Guzan.Once Carles Gil acrobatically volleyed a truly brilliant equaliser the game seemed anyone’s but with Yann M’Vila finally showing his central-midfield class the service to Defoe improved. When, in stoppage time, the 33-year-old striker swept a first-time shot home any lingering Villa optimism was extinguished.Bottom with eight points they have still to win under Rémi Garde and, unsurprisingly, the Frenchman – who declined to shake Allardyce’s hand at the end after being upset by his earlier failure to say hello – ducked the post-match press conference.“This isn’t easy for anyone, it doesn’t look good for us,” said Aly Cissokho, Villa’s left-back. “Everyone’s sad. We care. Everyone says we’re down now but we have to fight. We have to be professional. We’ll continue to give everything.” Perhaps Garde should copy Allardyce and install a cryotherapy chamber at the training ground. “It’s pretty horrible,” said Defoe. “It’s so cold, going in’s difficult. It’s minus 140C but it speeds up your recovery and if that’s what it takes …”Regular two-minute-long submissions to this icy torture chamber appear a price worth paying to keep playing. “I’d love a run in the team,” he said. “There’s some massive games to come and it’s not going to be easy but I feel really sharp.”Man of the match Jermain Defoe (Sunderland)

Claudio Ranieri’s safety-first principle means Leicester have nothing to lose
~~AUTHOR~~
Stuart James
~CONTENTS~
Claudio Ranieri would have known the question was coming and as soon as it was asked, Leicester City’s manager was quick to make the point that failing to score is only a problem when the chances dry up. Besides, Leicester’s manager was too busy celebrating reaching 40 points with a 0-0 draw against Bournemouth, talking about buying his players champagne and targeting another brilliant run of results to allow any mention of firing blanks to dampen his mood.In a marked change to his approach, Ranieri was throwing caution to the wind, rather than preaching it, after Leicester collected the point that, in the Italian’s eyes, guarantees another season of Premier League football and turns the rest of this campaign into a free hit. The 64-year-old almost had his calculator out at one stage. “What do we have to lose? Nothing,” he said. “We try to make 40 points, one point more [than the first half of the season]. Forty and 39 are 79, and I’m happy.”Riyad Mahrez’s missed penalty allows Bournemouth to frustrate Leicester Read moreWhile Leicester fans will be doing somersaults if they finish with that sort of haul, the short-term challenge is to start scoring again. Everything in moderation and all that over the festive period but the league’s highest scorers on Christmas Day were not supposed to turn off the tap in front of goal.Liverpool, Manchester City and now Bournemouth have frustrated Leicester, who have gone three games without scoring for the first time in 14 months. Before anyone calls for a postmortem into where it is all going wrong, it is not exactly crisis time when Leicester, who have been the story of the season so far, are sitting in second place, two points off the top.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Video: champagne for Leicester as they reach 40 points after draw with Bournemouth.If the recent run highlights one thing, however, it is the level of dependency on Jamie Vardy, who will miss this Saturday’s FA Cup tie at Tottenham after a minor groin operation, and Riyad Mahrez. They have accounted for 28 of Leicester’s 37 Premier League goals this season and should have added to their tallies here. To put it bluntly, who scores if Vardy and Mahrez do not?It is arguably an area for Leicester to look to address in the transfer window, just to ease the load a little on their star pair and also to capitalise on their brilliant first half of the season. Leonardo Ulloa, who was withdrawn at half-time, did not exactly make the most of his audition for a more regular role – the Argentinian’s most notable contribution was the miscued shot that dropped for Vardy to lash against the upright – and Shinji Okazaki, who came on as a 65th-minute substitute, is not seen as an out-and-out striker.Of course, if Mahrez had dispatched his penalty kick, after Simon Francis was harshly sent off for bringing down Vardy, the debate about the goal drought would never have surfaced. Artur Boruc, however, read Mahrez’s intentions and made a fine to save to help Bournemouth, for whom Josh King and Dan Gosling both had decent first-half chances, hold on to a valuable point.Eddie Howe has been keen to strengthen his own forward line in the wake of serious injuries to Callum Wilson and Max Gradel earlier in the season, and the Bournemouth manager sounded thrilled about the arrival of Juan Iturbe from Roma. The 22-year-old Argentinian, who is awaiting a work permit, joined Roma from Verona for £17.4m only 18 months ago.“I’m excited to see him play for us,” Howe said. “I think he can add elements that this team still needs, a little bit more creativity and individual skill. It is the type of signing that shows we are ambitious. He’s got a lovely left foot, he is quick, athletic.“I don’t think you go for the transfer fee he has if you’re not a hugely talented boy. Obviously, we have to fit him into our style and way of working but hopefully he’ll bring goals and that creative spark that we need.”At the same time, Howe called for fans to be patient. “The fact he is coming from a foreign country and doesn’t speak great English; that’s all you need to know in respect that we can’t expect him to save our season,” he said. “Hopefully he can add little bits in time that will help us get there.”Man of the match Artur Boruc (Bournemouth)

Darren Way wants Yeovil to avoid complacency after vital win over York
~~AUTHOR~~
Jeremy Alexander
~CONTENTS~
Yeovil know their place. It was clear before a League Two ball was kicked in August and earnest. Only York were below them and on Saturday, as the teams met at Huish Park, Yeovil restored alphabetical order with a 1-0 win that lifted them off the bottom and, with Dagenham & Redbridge’s victory at Exeter, dumped York there instead. Now they can begin again in the second half.It was Yeovil’s first league win in 17 games since September and their first at home since August. Two seasons ago they were in the Championship but last place there, when they won eight games and were seven points from safety, and again in League One, when they were nine points from 23rd place, amounted to free fall. They won seven matches in 2015. Defeat on Saturday would have left them five points adrift and staring at the fifth division they left in 2003. York have been there more recently, from 2004 to 2012. Desperate significance as much as sodden pitch defined the play.Both clubs have new managers. York’s Jackie McNamara, late of Dundee United, ended a run of seven defeats, only five on his watch, with four points from two games either side of Christmas. Darren Way, caretaking from early December in place of Paul Sturrock, managed three draws in four league games for Yeovil after an FA Cup win that takes them to face Carlisle on Saturday. “It’s important we don’t become complacent,” he said on the strength of it, still in last place.Way is green to the core, born in Plymouth, starting at Norwich and playing over 250 games for Yeovil before a car crash in which he was a passenger ended his playing career at 29 in 2008. His midfield energy and 5ft 6in earned him the moniker Weasel and the same commitment to the club in coaching roles has earned him his new position, confirmed on New Year’s Eve, which he assumes with Terry Skiverton, another club stalwart and team-mate in their ascent from the Conference, as assistant. Where there’s a Way there’s a will.Yeovil Town appoint former midfielder Darren Way as permanent manager Read more“One thing I’ve tried to do is get the players closer to supporters,” he said, and it showed in the match taking place at all. Twenty volunteers helped cover the pitch against rain, which was then tipped off so the playing surface resembled an island. It was hardly a billiard table for the players but cannon to right of them, cannon to left of them, cannon in front of them volleyed and thundered and occasionally the cue ball ended up with a team-mate. The match pleaded for poise in possession and care in passing to put down markers but the latter were mostly in charge.York’s Vadaine Oliver might have done better with a far-post header to Danny Galbraith’s early cross but Danny Ward and Jakub Sokolik were generally too assertive in Yeovil’s central defence to give him the scope that has made him the club’s leading scorer. Ward was on a short-term loan from Crawley but, at 37, was pleased to accept Way’s offer of captaincy and a contract to June 2017.The manager is now working to hold on to François Zoko, rightly man of the match and winner of the 40th-minute penalty when brought down by the luckless Luke Summerfield. “Fans have had a lot of pain lately,” said Matt Dolan, a latter-day Weasel, who converted it. An exciting late debut cameo from Tahvon Campbell, an 18-year-old striker newly on loan from West Brom, might have doubled the lead in added time but for Scott Flinders’ block, which matched one a minute earlier by Artur Krysiak from Kenny McEvoy. The game had come alive when it was almost dead.McNamara said afterwards: “Our last pass wasn’t quite there [nor, for that matter, were many first ones on either side] but I have no worries going forward.” Going downward may be something else. “We’ve had a magical journey over the years and now a little bit of adversity and we’ve got to make sure it doesn’t get any worse,” Way said. His chairman, John Fry, admitted recently their troubles began in the Championship, where he could see no responsible financial way to take on the Premier League parachutists. Now they and York will simply be glad to land safely on dry land in May for League Two next season.

Gary Neville’s Valencia hold Real Madrid to thrilling draw
~~AUTHOR~~
Sid Lowe
~CONTENTS~
Real Madrid’s players were still celebrating the goal they thought had given them a huge victory at Mestalla when Rafa Benítez approached them on the touchline and gestured for them to ensure that the game ended there. Gareth Bale had just headed them into a 2-1 lead with seven minutes left, despite being down to 10 men, and the manager knew better than anyone how significant this was. Under the pressure he is, a win guaranteed he remained in a job; defeat, maybe even a draw, would mean another week of speculation and possibly the sack.But barely had he turned back towards the bench than Valencia were level again. One minute and 11 seconds passed between Bale’s superb looping effort hitting the net and Paco Alcácer reaching Rodrigo’s nod down to head past Keylor Navas and make it 2-2. Remarkably it was still not over, either: there was time for one more chance each in the very last minute of an enthralling game that had begun with Madrid taking the lead and ended with a collective coronary, followed by applause.It had been a fascinating and ultimately frantic match; a vitally important one that, in the end left neither manager entirely satisfied but with much to be satisfied about. As the dust settles, judgments will be refined but it was also a game that may have strengthened Benítez and Gary Neville.Neville still awaits his first league win at Valencia but he described this as a “fantastic” performance, their best under him. He also said it is his wish to continue as Valencia manager next season but that he must earn that opportunity. If they play like this, he will.Management is not my long-term goal, says Valencia head coach Gary Neville Read moreAs for Benítez, he was asked the now traditional question as to whether he fears for his future. “That question only [makes sense] if we only look at the result,” he said. “This performance deserves more praise than criticism. I can’t avoid that people speculate [about my future]. But I can make sure that the team works the way it did today.”Benítez’s side had taken the lead with a wonderful goal after a quarter of an hour. Karim Benzema slotted the ball to Bale who back-heeled it to Ronaldo on the edge of the area. He stopped it with his back to goal and, looking left, nudged it to the right with the outside of his foot for Benzema to take one quick touch and then finish, low into the far corner. It had all happened in tight space, the passing swift, the touch perfect, a goal that almost had the feel of basketball to itValencia, though, were soon on the front foot and the avenues they found were wide ones, through the middle of the pitch on either side of Toni Kroos, leading to Navas’s penalty area. André Gomes, in particular, was dangerous and, even if clear chances did not always materialise, the threat was there.João Cancelo headed wide, six yards out, from Rodrigo De Paul’s delivery; Sergio Ramos had to block a neat combination from De Paul and Gomes; and from the corner the ball hit Aymen Abdennour in the face who then could not steer his shot in from a few yards. Then, a moment after that, Paco Alcácer’s shot was deflected wide. Just before half-time Gomes again ran into the area. This time he was brought down by Pepe and Dani Parejo scored the penalty.The second half started with Madrid keen to re-establish the lead, pushing Valencia back and finding their way into the area, with Marcelo overlapping on the left, but it was not sustained. Valencia soon took possession and took control. Navas made an unorthodox save from Gomes as Madrid got deeper and at the other end Ronaldo shot over.Benítez then took off Benzema and shifted to 4-4-2. It did not last. As Valencia broke upfield following a Ronaldo tumble in the area three minutes later, Mateo Kovacic was sent off for a wild challenge on Cancelo. Analysing the game afterwards, Neville bemoaned the fact that easier possession made for slower possession and it was then Madrid who took the lead, and thought they had won it, when Bale scored from a Kroos free-kick seven minutes from the end.Seventy-one seconds later they had lost the lead. “All you can do is lament that,” Benítez said. Neville, meanwhile, went for the throat. On came Álvaro Negredo and in the very last minute he was sent clean through but could not take the chance. Suddenly Bale was running through and shooting over. Both were big moments, whose consequences might be felt well beyond tonight. “We could have won,” Neville said. “We could have lost too.”Valencia v Real Madrid: La Liga – as it happened Read more

Liverpool are close to completing their first signing of the January transfer window with Red Star Belgrade midfielder Marko Grujic due to undergo a medical on Merseyside on Monday.Exeter’s Paul Tisdale ready to battle Jürgen Klopp in hipster stakes and Cup Read moreThe 19-year-old playmaker has chosen a £5m move to Anfield over interest from Internazionale and Chelsea following a personal intervention by Liverpool manager Jürgen Klopp, acting on the advice of his Serbian assistant, Zeljko Buvac. Grujic, a Serbia under-21 international, will spend the rest of the season on loan at Red Star before returning to Liverpool in the summer.Grujic’s transfer is expected to be sealed swiftly after the medical with personal terms agreed with Liverpool chief executive Ian Ayre during talks in Belgrade before Christmas.The playmaker has been a major influence on Red Star’s commanding lead at the top of the Serbian league and will become Klopp’s first signing as Liverpool manager. Liverpool are also hoping to strike a pre-contract agreement in January with the Schalke defender Joel Matip, who is out of contract with the Bundesliga club next summer.

Tottenham’s Dele Alli wins battle against Everton’s Ross Barkley
~~AUTHOR~~
Michael Cox
~CONTENTS~
In a hugely entertaining contest between two technical, high-energy, attack-minded sides, it was notable that both goals came from direct attacks, following long balls from deep. Everton’s opener was a simple move. Tom Cleverley picked up possession to the left of midfield and immediately knocked a long diagonal pass towards Romelu Lukaku. He intelligently nodded the ball down for Aaron Lennon, who converted impressively against his former club.It was an atypical goal for Everton, who usually depend on their attacking midfielders for creating chances, but as they were closed down intensely by a well-drilled Spurs side and unable to play combinations through the centre of the pitch, bypassing the press with a long ball worked effectively. Jan Vertonghen and Toby Alderweireld are both front-foot central defenders keen to intercept the ball on the floor, and looked less comfortable competing against their Belgian compatriot Lukaku in the air.Dele Alli’s brilliance gives Tottenham Hotspur point but Everton rally Read moreSpurs’ equaliser, meanwhile, was interesting in a different sense and was even more direct. Alderweireld advanced forward in possession and lofted a long ball over Everton’s defence for the onrushing Dele Alli. He had charged between Seamus Coleman and John Stones before producing a finish which was simultaneously composed and acrobatic.This was one of the first times in the game that a midfield player had sprinted in advance of his centre-forward and Alli’s sudden movement took the Everton backline by surprise. Because both sides were keen to get the upper hand in the centre of the pitch, Ross Barkley and Christian Eriksen spent the majority of the game dropping deep, rather than offering penetration. Alli provided a refreshing alternative.Alli’s goal was identical to his opener in a 1-1 draw at West Bromwich Albion last month – Alderweireld hitting the long diagonal pass from just inside his own half, Alli rushing forward and collecting the ball near the penalty spot. He made the same run twice in the opening minutes of the second half, too, on both occasions teeing up Harry Kane and demonstrating the wonderful first touch which makes him such an immediately impressive footballer. Alli had six attempts at goal here, twice as many as anyone else on the pitch.That directness itself, though, makes Alli so thrilling. For all the immediacy in Tottenham’s method of regaining possession, there is sometimes a frustrating sluggishness with the ball – Eriksen and Kane tend to come deep, Lamela sometimes goes in behind the defence but tends to drift inside from his wide position. Forward running usually comes from the full-backs, with Kyle Walker particularly aggressive here.To prevent Spurs playing in front of the opposition they require runs in behind – and while it is unusual for that to come from the No10, where Alli started today, it makes it particularly unpredictable.It is a quality notably lacking from Barkley’s game at the moment and in the battle between two of the brightest young English midfielders around Alli clearly got the upper hand.

Guus Hiddink praises Chelsea’s glamour players as ‘dirty work’ pays off
~~AUTHOR~~
David Hytner
~CONTENTS~
Guus Hiddink said Chelsea’s glamour players are doing the “dirty work” to give the team a platform to emerge from the trauma of the first half of the Premier League season.The manager watched his side win 3-0 at Crystal Palace on Sunday – the first victory of his second spell in caretaker charge – and he talked afterwards of them being better balanced and more secure, a feeling that was helped, he said, by the authority of Mikel John Obi in defensive midfield.Hiddink noted that even Oscar, the attacking midfielder, who scored the opening goal, had mucked in on the physical side of things, despite tackling not being his strong point.Chelsea swagger past Crystal Palace with Willian goal a gem for Hiddink Read more“If a team is not doing well for a very long period, it is rather human to look for security,” Hiddink said. “That is why we have emphasised the good, hard work, tactically and in a defensive way.“We don’t need to add a lot to the quality of the players. When they get the ball, they know how to play. But they have to know that once things are not going as wished, we have to look for causes. That is why we started working. The very talented players, they start working to invest in what I call the ‘dirty work’ and not just the beautiful game that they can play.“This league is very demanding. And if you think that you can do it just on your quality, which is given by nature, then this league is killing you. They start working. Oscar starts working, also. Oscar was doing what is not his big quality. He was tackling a bit.”Hiddink, though, made the point that he did not want his team merely to sit back and protect a lead. To him, real security is provided by hard work all over the pitch. “I don’t like to see a team drop back very far, to seek false security but to look forwards and to get the ball as soon as possible,” he said.Hiddink watched Cesc Fàbregas, who was back in the team after illness, produce an influential display in central midfield but he agreed that Mikel had put down the foundations. “It’s balance,” Hiddink said. “If we have three very creative players [in midfield] … it’s possible but in this league, it’s difficult. That’s why we look for the balance. John Obi is the ideal player to bring balance back to the team.“Previously Chelsea conceded a lot of goals and you can say that the four defenders are not going their jobs. But if the team is not willing to defend well, or does not have the right balance, then you concede a lot of goals. John Obi can recover the ball and he reads the game very well. A player who can defend so smoothly, for me, is beautiful to see.”

Chelsea play for their futures but it is probably too late to stop purge
~~AUTHOR~~
Barney Ronay
~CONTENTS~
Chelsea’s second goal on an afternoon when the sky seemed to have been gouged open, dumping an entire ocean of January rain on Selhurst Park, was a rare moment of beauty. Scott Dann blocked a forward surge by Oscar, a ferrety influence at No10 all afternoon. The ball broke to Willian who spanked it without hesitation into the top corner, the ball still rising as it zinged past Wayne Hennessey. Three minutes later, with the champions swaggering about the squelchy turf, zipping the ball between a revolving front four, Diego Costa tapped home the third to seal a fluent, energetic, largely pointless victory.It isn’t hard to see how those with a pro- or anti-José Mourinho agenda will interpret the evidence of Chelsea’s best away win of the season. Take your pick. Either the players have finally thrown off their mental chains, lanced the José-flavoured boil and under sensitive, grown-up Guus can finally express those trapped creative urges.Guus Hiddink praises Chelsea’s glamour players as their ‘dirty work’ pays off Read moreOr, on the other hand, sometimes freedom’s just another word for nothing left to lose. Having killed their own league season and rid themselves of an overbearing manager Chelsea’s players are now free to fight for their own futures. The title defence was dead before the autumn was out. The rest is simply divvying up the corpse.The truth, as ever, is probably somewhere in between. Chelsea were excellent here against a stodgy Palace team deprived of the craft and urgency of Yohan Cabaye and Yannick Bolasie, and with only two goals in six games since the start of December.Cesc Fàbregas has been trundling about like a three-wheeled shopping trolley for the last six months. Here he played like man slowly waking up. All over the pitch Chelsea players were making runs and finding space where in recent months the works of this champion team have seemed to be gummed with fluff. Costa’s extra work on his conditioning seems to be paying off. Willian was irrepressible again. Mikel Jon Obi passed sideways and stuck a foot in on a day when passing sideways and sticking a foot in were exactly what was needed. Chelsea worked hard in every position. Football looked like a simple game again.Welcome to the new era! At the final whistle the champions were 7-1 with the bookies to finish in the top four, a feat that would require them to make up 13 points on Tottenham Hotspur – or 17 on Leicester City – in the course of 18 league fixtures. If this seems unlikely, even on an afternoon when the travelling support thoroughly enjoyed finally catching a glimpse of the team behind the team, that fluent title-bound Chelsea of autumn 2014, then the real question from here is what degree of structural work this slightly muddled squad is going to need once the current holding pattern ends.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest  Guus Hiddink hails Chelsea’s 3-0 win against Crystal PalaceIt is a question that goes to the heart of what exactly the hierarchy and ultimately the owner, Roman Abramovich, wants to do with the club from here. There has been an admirable constancy about Chelsea’s fans through the recent bumps in the road. Support for Mourinho scarcely wavered to the end and it isn’t hard to see why. The new-age Chelsea has effectively been a Mourinho joint from the start of the title-winning era to the current hiatus. Even in the interregnum years the spine, guts and brain of the team that became champions of Europe was at bottom a Mourinho-flavoured entity.At times you wonder if Abramovich, spurred into buying a football club by the intoxicating spectacle of Real Madrid’s galácticos, doesn’t sometimes rub his eyes and wonder if this was really what he wanted all along. Lolling in his executive box all those years he must now and then have wondered how things might have turned out in a parallel world, the non-Mourinho timeline in which Pep Guardiola might have been lured to west London or where perhaps that charming, cavalier team of the immediate pre-Roman years, the Chelsea of Zola-Gullit-Vialli, were upgraded and re-geared rather than flushed out by the new efficiencies.Either way it is hard to avoid the conclusion what Chelsea need now is a proper purge, a manager with the guts, spleen, balls and unblinking stare to winkle out the remaining parts of that enduring spine. The links with Diego Simeone make sense. Atlético Madrid’s manager looks an obvious tonic, not just the best young-ish manager in Europe but one who carries with him a prominent set of knuckle-dusters.It will, though, take more than a little dead-rubber urgency against an ailing Palace team to convince such an unforgiving presence this group of players has the warrior-like sense of unity Simeone demands. Chelsea’s league season may effectively be over. But the season within the season, the battle to be a part of the future, may have just got under way.

Dele Alli’s brilliance gives Tottenham Hotspur point but Everton rally
~~AUTHOR~~
Andy Hunter
~CONTENTS~
The silence in the Tottenham Hotspur dressing room at Goodison Park spoke volumes about the ambition contained within. “Always at the end of a game we play some music but not today because the players are very disappointed and feel we have dropped two points,” said Mauricio Pochettino. “That is a good sign for the future.” One his gifted young group appear capable of addressing.Spurs produced a dominant first-half display at Everton, a season’s best according to their manager, Dele Alli again demonstrated his precocious talent with a superb goal and Hugo Lloris enjoyed a quiet afternoon until Roberto Martínez’s side rallied in the second half. But they had to settle for a point – one the home side merited for their belated improvement and Aaron Lennon’s impressive strike against his former club – for the ninth time this season.Tottenham’s Dele Alli wins battle against Everton’s Ross Barkley | Michael Cox Read moreA failure to turn control into victories threatens to undermine talk of a Tottenham title challenge – talk that mostly originates from outside White Hart Lane, admittedly – but Pochettino did not shy away from the potential in his squad afterwards. “It is too early to speak about some challenge or achievements at the end of the season,” he said. “But we are very ambitious. Maybe tomorrow we can analyse the game and feel proud, and be happy for the point, but now our feeling is disappointment that we have dropped two points. We are the youngest squad in the Premier League but we show our winning mentality.”Pochettino’s team dominated possession from the first whistle to the moment Lennon put Everton ahead from their first attack. Martínez claimed he was happy for Spurs to do so. “We stopped their main players from getting on the ball and hurting us,” said the Everton manager, somewhat optimistically.Intense pressing and accuracy in possession left the home side encamped in their own half for the opening 45 minutes and brought simmering frustrations over Everton’s run of one win in six league games to the surface. There were ironic cheers from the Gwladys Street stand when Tim Howard collected a routine cross for the second home match in succession. As in the 4-3 loss to Stoke City on Monday, the USA international reacted to the self-defeating noises from his own supporters. John Stones also exchanged words with Everton fans after over-elaborating inside his area late on.It needed a superb intervention from Séamus Coleman to prevent Alli converting Kyle Walker’s low cross from Tottenham’s first meaningful attack. Moments later Pochettino’s side struck Everton’s woodwork for the first time when Harry Kane beat Howard from distance only for his low drive to rebound clear off the inside of a post.Everton did not have one touch in the final third in the opening 19 minutes yet stunned Spurs by piercing Lloris’s defence with their first attack. In another echo of the Stoke defeat, specifically Romelu Lukaku’s second goal, Tom Cleverley swept a fine cross-field ball into the Belgium international lurking with intent in the box. This time Lukaku cushioned a header down for Lennon, who took one touch before steering his shot beyond Lloris’s right hand.The goal was Lennon’s first since joining Everton on a permanent £4.5m deal from Tottenham in the summer and clearly satisfying for a player who ended his White Hart Lane career training with the club’s youngsters. Lennon was afforded a warm reception by the Spurs supporters when replaced by Gerard Deulofeu on the hour, his withdrawal prompting boos from the home crowd.Everton v Tottenham: Premier League – as it happened Read moreEverton’s lead did not change the flow of the first half and Ben Davies hit Howard’s crossbar with a thunderous left-foot shot from Christian Eriksen’s corner. Tottenham levelled in stoppage time, the manner of their equaliser more surprising than its arrival. Having failed to capitalise on one of their intricate passing moves around the Everton area the visitors went long with their final attack of an impressive half. Toby Alderweireld dissected Everton’s central defence with a long ball that Alli read perfectly and executed superbly, stealing in ahead of Coleman to control on his chest before sending a first-time volley beyond Howard.Martínez’s team reacted as they had to in the second half, with far more aggression and adventure on the ball, although Kane was close to a second for Spurs when Alli expertly chested the ball over the Everton defence. Lukaku was millimetres from connecting with Deulofeu’s inviting cross to the far post while another Everton substitute, the impressive Muhamed Besic, drew a finger-tip save from Lloris with a volley from 18 yards.Everton continued to press for a winner in the closing stages and Lloris, rarely troubled for an hour, was ultimately the busier keeper as the game opened up into an entertaining, end-to-end affair. Ross Barkley forced the France international into a low save with the final touch of the match and Spurs were left to reflect on what might, or should, have been. With the music off.Man of the match Dele Alli (Tottenham)

Celtic’s Leigh Griffiths looks to Stranraer after securing needed win
~CONTENTS~
Leigh Griffiths has acknowledged that Celtic will be under pressure to win comfortably when they visit Stranraer in the Scottish Cup next Sunday.The Hoops striker scored a last-gasp winner against Partick Thistle at Parkhead on Saturday after replacing the struggling Nadir Ciftci at the start of the second half following an insipid display from the home side in the first 45 minutes.The Celtic midfielder Nir Bitton was sent off by the referee, Stephen Finnie, in the 67th minute for picking up two yellow cards and while that seemed to spur on Ronny Deila’s side, it looked like the Jags would take a point amid growing frustration from the home support.However, Griffiths, back after a calf injury kept him out for four games, struck with a drive in the 89th minute – his 20th goal of the season – for Celtic’s first home win since beating Aberdeen on Halloween, a victory that Griffiths said Deila “probably needed”.The win took the champions three points clear of the Dons at the top of the Premiership with a game in hand over the Pittodrie men, whose match at St Johnstone was cancelled because of a waterlogged pitch.“It was good to get back on,” said Griffiths, who then turned his attention to the fourth-round cup tie against the League One side, where Celtic will look to keep their treble dreams alive.“There is going to be pressure on us to win the game, comfortably as well,” said Griffiths. “But we will go down there, Stranraer will make it difficult for us. We have to adapt to conditions and whatever team goes out we are confident of getting through.“I think it will be the first time I will have been to Stair Park so hopefully it will be a good game, not too much trouble.“We look forward to it, the gaffer will look forward to it, he will have a game plan and will try to get into the next round.”It was Thistle’s first defeat in seven games but their defender Danny Seaborne said they had been undone by a striker enjoying a great run of form. “It was gutting to lose a goal so late in the game. Leigh is in great form, so it is one of those things you have to take,” Seaborne said.Meanwhile, Kenny Miller said no one in the Rangers lineup can afford to think their place is safe, even after hitting Dumbarton for six. The veteran striker bagged a hat-trick as the Ibrox men ran riot at the Cheaper Insurance Direct Stadium with a 6-0 win.It was Rangers’ biggest win under Mark Warburton but, with the Championship race looking like it could go to the wire, the Englishman is set to add even more new faces to his squad this month.He has already signed the winger Harry Forrester from Doncaster until the end of the season for an undisclosed fee, while the Polish goalkeeper Maciej Gostomski could follow this week.A defender also remains high on Warburton’s wishlist but Miller issued a warning to his team-mates.He said: “When you’re at a club and you get to a transfer window, you’re always looking to strengthen and the manager says if the right player becomes available, then we’ll be in for them.“If we strengthen then that will benefit the team. The lads who have the jersey will be out to keep it, but it’s up to them to keep performing, keep scoring goals, keep defending. It will serve a purpose of keeping the lads on their toes.”Miller scrambled home the opener against Dumbarton three minutes from half-time before scoring with a precision header after an hour. He wrapped up his treble soon afterwards by slotting the ball past Mark Brown in the home goal. Martyn Waghorn fired home the fourth while Andy Halliday got in on the act with a deflected free-kick and James Tavernier also scored.

Chelsea swagger past Crystal Palace with Willian goal a gem for Hiddink
~~AUTHOR~~
David Hytner
~CONTENTS~
Chelsea supporters would love to think that the second half of 2015 was simply a bad dream. Sadly for them, it was grotesquely real but the new year got under way in cathartic fashion for them and there was even evidence of their old champion swagger and steel.It was as if a switch had been flicked on the misery of the preceding months, as the caretaker manager, Guus Hiddink, enjoyed the first victory of his second spell at the club and Willian, the game’s outstanding individual, produced the outstanding moment. His stinging drive from outside the area for Chelsea’s second goal was still rising when it ripped into the roof of the net.Crystal Palace v Chelsea: Premier League – as it happened Read moreChelsea had started the day three points above the relegation zone and with only four teams beneath them, and a case could be made for next Sunday’s FA Cup tie at home to League One Scunthorpe United being the bigger game. The table looked a little better for them after this and, although much of the meaning has been stripped from their Premier League season, the team did feel much more like their old selves.Diego Costa and Cesc Fàbregas returned from suspension and illness respectively and both were influential, with the former setting up the opening goal for Oscar and scoring the third himself. Fàbregas pulled the strings in midfield, supported by the excellent Mikel John Obi, and it was revealing to hear a post-match comment from Alan Pardew, the Crystal Palace manager.“Looking at the Chelsea players now and speaking to one or two of them coming off the pitch, they all feel they haven’t played well [over the first-half of the season],” Pardew said. “I said to Fàbregas: ‘You were brilliant today.’ And he said: ‘Well, it’s taken a while’.”Palace were chasing the league double over their London neighbours, having won at Stamford Bridge in August – the first real surprise result of the José Mourinho implosion – but they were breached here by Chelsea’s slick football and they had no answers of their own.Palace ran aground after the 29th-minute concession to Oscar while Chelsea went from strength to strength, with the early loss of Eden Hazard to a groin problem reduced to little more than a footnote.Hazard had tried to carry on only to plonk himself down on the turf, moments after losing out tamely to Joel Ward by the corner flag, and indicate that his game was over. He was a snapshot in loneliness as he trudged off towards the tunnel and he will undergo a scan on Monday.Chelsea’s breakthrough goal was marked by high-end quality, which sparkled amid the gloomy weather and sparked happiness inside the travelling enclosure. “We are staying up,” the Chelsea fans chanted.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Willian celebrates scoring Chelsea’s second at Crystal Palace, a fine team goal. He was involved in the third goal, too, his parried shot turned in by Diego Costa Photograph: Adrian Dennis/AFP/Getty ImagesFàbregas, back at the expense of Nemanja Matic rather than Mikel, was the initial creator, sliding a ball through for Costa, after the striker had spun off his marker to run in behind. Costa cut a lovely, disguised cross back for Oscar and the midfielder tapped home from close range.Hazard’s replacement, Pedro, was industrious on the left and Chelsea made inroads up that side. They might have had the second in the 37th minute when Fàbregas, again, cut Palace apart with a ball forward, this time for César Azpilicueta. The left-back’s first touch on his chest was true and, one-on-one with Wayne Hennessey from a tight angle, he was denied by a block from the goalkeeper. Kurt Zouma also missed with a free header from Willian’s free-kick shortly after the interval.The tackles flew in. Damien Delaney and Scott Dann were both booked for kicking Costa but he kept his cool, exacting revenge with his football. Palace had drawn blanks in their previous two outings and the continued absence of the injured Yannick Bolasie was compounded by the loss of Yohan Cabaye to a ban after five yellow cards. Both creators were missed as Palace groped for a cutting edge against a Chelsea defence that was well protected by Mikel. He kept everything cool and simple.Fraizer Campbell had gone close with Palace’s only first-half chance in the 26th minute, following Jason Puncheon’s dangerous cross, and they flickered in the 59th minute through Wilfried Zaha. Teed up by Campbell after Chelsea had appealed in vain for a foul on Costa, Zaha’s shot was scuffed somewhat and Thibaut Courtois stretched to save.Moments later, the game was over. Willian started the move, working the ball to Fàbregas, who found Oscar and, when the ball broke following Dann’s tackle, Willian strode on to it and let fly. Hennessey felt it scorch past him. Chelsea got the third shortly afterwards when Willian teased James McArthur before shooting. Hennessey pushed it out but only as far as Costa and he bundled his effort home off Ward.Man of the match Willian (Chelsea)

Management is not my long-term goal, says Valencia head coach Gary Neville
~CONTENTS~
The former England and Manchester United defender Gary Neville is not targeting a long-term career in management and says he is “relaxed” about how long he stays at the helm of Valencia. The England assistant coach made a surprise move to the Spanish club last month to take up his first managerial post until the end of the season, but insists his future lies in other projects.Gary Neville says Valencia will not rush into transfer market after derby defeat Read more“I’m not going to say where I want to end up, and it isn’t in management or head coaching, so I want to be clear about that,” Neville, who has been linked as a possible replacement for the under pressure Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal, told Sky Sports. “That’s not my ultimate goal of where I want to be.”Neville was juggling his England role with punditry work for Sky Sports and co-ownership of Salford City among other interests before moving to Valencia, where he confesses language problems during half-time team talks have been “the biggest frustration and challenge so far”.“From my point of view, I was really enjoying what I was doing, I really was, the multiple things I had on, even though I knew it was coming to a point where I had to make decisions at the end of this season,” added Neville.“I think it is uncertain the amount of time I’ll be here but [even] if I got given a five-year contract I think it would be uncertain about the amount of time I’d be here. That’s why I’m relaxed.”Neville, who is England’s most-capped right back with 85 caps, said the national side needed to go through the “pain” of failing at the last World Cup in order to improve.The 40-year-old, who retired in 2011, believes manager Roy Hodgson deserves credit for having “completely transformed” the squad in recent years, lowering its average age from 28 to “24, 25”.“People say ’Oh the World Cup was a bad result’ but what do you expect when you are transitioning from Ferdinand, Terry, Cole, Lampard, Gerrard … to a new group of players,” Neville told the Sunday Telegraph.“There has to be some sort of pain along the way and I just feel the way he [Hodgson] managed that transition – and I am thinking of specific discussions I had with him with England as a coaching team – he’s proven to be right.”England failed to get out of the group stages in Brazil in 2014 but go into Euro 2016 with 10 wins out of 10 in qualification.“The idea of saying ’it has to semis, quarters’, we’ve gone past that,” Neville added. “We’ve had too many experiences of wild statements. I played in four tournaments [for England] with managers who said ’we are going to win it’ and it was ’rah, rah, rah wonderful’. Let’s just think about doing the right things.”

Louis van Gaal: entertaining the media, if not Manchester United’s fans
~~AUTHOR~~
Barry Glendenning
~CONTENTS~
In 1998, Louis van Gaal approached Sir Alex Ferguson with a request for advice on how best to deal with the press. Well known for the breezy bonhomie that characterised his own relations with the media, the then Manchester United manager’s curt response of “Don’t read it,” appears to have gone resolutely ignored in the intervening 17 years. Despite revealing last summer that British reporters “are nicer than the Dutch, nicer than the Spanish” – but curiously not as nice as the Germans – Van Gaal’s relationship with the British press pack has since deteriorated to an alarming, but often comically entertaining, degree.Like Ebenezer Scrooge railing against the poor and destitute, the Dutchman spent Christmas griping about the football writers with whom he is forced, increasingly under sufferance, to deal with on a weekly basis. His grumbles about media-perpetrated “lies” will have come as little surprise to anyone familiar with a career-long relationship with the Fourth Estate that has always been fractious.Anthony Martial and Wayne Rooney prove Manchester United’s ghostbusters | Paul Wilson Read more“So much of what’s written about me has nothing to do with the truth or the facts,” he once told a group of Dutch hacks during his time as the manager of Ajax. “All I ever read about myself is how arrogant I am. I’m self-assured, I have an opinion, I walk tall. With my bearing and my personality, it’s all too easy to be dismissed as arrogant.”In a spectacularly furious press conference tirade following an Ajax match against NAC Breda in 1996, Van Gaal rounded on Voetbal International journalist Ted van Leeuwen, who had asked a question about the manager’s relationship with his players to which he took exception. “Am I so smart or are you so stupid?!” he roared, his query instantly becoming the stuff of Dutch football legend, while perhaps suggesting it might not be his bearing and personality alone that prompt some folk to dismiss him as arrogant.More recently, under pressure following United’s defeat at the hands of Stoke City, talk turned to the likelihood of him keeping his job and Van Gaal suggested that as an alternative to having his P45 forced upon him, he could always resign. When reporters quite reasonably interpreted these comments to mean that he might seriously be considering his position, he responded with the kind of haughty disdain for which his name, fairly or unfairly, has long been a byword.“They are lies, not based on facts,” he fumed. “Will I resign? On the contrary. When the players can give such a performance with a lot of pressure, there is not any pressure to resign for me. Maybe the media wants me to but I shall not resign.” Just before Christmas, Van Gaal had been in equally spiky form, asking for an apology from journalists he felt were prematurely reporting a demise that was anything but imminent. “I think I was already sacked, I have read,” he harrumphed at his weekly briefing, before wishing his interrogators a merry Christmas in a tone that suggested his own festive enjoyment would be greatly enhanced if they all choked on their wine and mince pies.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest  Manchester United win over Swansea a starting point, says Louis van GaalPart savage hatchet job, part endearing homage, O Louis was one of the more entertaining football tomes to be published in recent times. It was written by the Dutch football journalist and television pundit Hugo Borst, who once knew Van Gaal well enough to take golf tips from the great man but subsequently fell out with him when the manager accused Borst of passing on his phone number to another journalist without permission. By his own admission totally obsessed with Van Gaal, Borst wrote an often brutal book that is nothing if not an entertaining read. At times quite disturbing, it contains often harrowing and downright cruel assessments of the manager and his relationship with various players, his wife Truus, the media and alcohol.Putting aside the dubious ethics of a wheeze that involved Borst sitting down with a psychiatrist best known for appearing on a reality TV show called Holland’s Worst Husband in a bid to analyse Van Gaal’s character, what Bram Bakker had to say about the United manager’s battles with assorted journalists made for interesting reading. Despite never having met the subject of his analysis, Bakker had studied his official biography and arrived at the rather damning conclusion that Van Gaal is a deeply suspicious man with an inferiority complex who tends towards paranoia and needs immediate psychiatric help.“Try to imagine that people who are aggressive are always fearful at heart,” he explained to Borst. “Because you only need to be aggressive when you feel threatened. So ultimately all aggression is triggered by some kind of fear. Look at Louis van Gaal that way and what you see is a frightened little boy.” Reporters on the Manchester football beat could be forgiven for taking Bakker’s analysis with a pinch of salt, not least those who have been subjected to Van Gaal’s death stare followed by a series of mocking questions about the apparent stupidity of their own particular lines of interrogation.Van Gaal is by no means the first football manager to make little secret of his contempt for those tasked with chronicling the day-to-day activities of his team – but few have ever gone about it in a more consistently entertaining way. We should be grateful that United’s weekend victory over Swansea City looks certain to keep him in a job; United’s performances on the football field this season may have been characterised by a lack of entertainment but their manager’s press briefings remain compulsive viewing.

Melbourne Victory break Hunter Stadium A-League hoodoo in Jets win
~CONTENTS~
Hunter Stadium has finally become a happy A-League hunting ground for Kevin Muscat, after his below-par Melbourne Victory put Newcastle to the sword 1-0 on Sunday. Ninkovic A-League double hauls Sydney back for draw against City Read moreFahid Ben Khalfallah’s second-half winner was eight games and more than six years coming at this venue, snapping the club’s long-time hoodoo and their five-match winless slump at Hunter. For 71 painstaking minutes, it looked like neither side would break an end-to-end deadlock characterised by long balls and scarce pretty play. But Victory ensured they remained in fifth place at the season’s halfway point and closed the gap on Sydney FC to one point.It leaves the deflated eighth-placed Jets winless in nine attempts and without a goal in 469 minutes and five matches, only one match less than the now-defunct New Zealand Knights’ all-time record of six back in 2006.Victory opened with a flurry and forced Newcastle gloveman Mark Birighitti into a few quick saves, including a potential own goal from Jason Hoffman, who got stuck in a scramble to block Ben Kantarovski’s goalward drive. It was touch-and-go when Archie Thompson smacked the deflection back Birighitti’s way but it hit the upright.With defenders Hoffman, Daniel Mullen and skipper Nigel Boogaard finally together again, the Jets weathered the early storm and worked their way back into possession. They fashioned admirable opportunities, but yet again lacked the polish to whittle them into anything meaningful.Perhaps the absence of suspended winger David Carney and perennially injured playmaker Leonardo had an impact, but glimpses of good play between Serbians Milos Trifunovic and Enver Alivodic did not trouble Victory ‘keeper Danny Vukovic. Victory, meanwhile, were rickety, seemingly without a feasible game plan as they dallied in purposeless possession. The closest they – or indeed either side – came to opening the book before Ben Khalfalla’s goal, was in the 53rd minute, when Oliver Bozanic cracked a shot dead on target as Birighitti loitered vulnerably off his line. But Hoffman was in position for the vital block.As the match wore on, yellow-carded Besart Berisha became a time bomb of mouthy agitation and one that didn’t stop ticking, even when Kosta Barbarouses galloped downfield in transition and put the winner on a plate for Ben Khalfallah. Khalfallah himself had stealthily run out wide and back inside to isolate Birighitti, as Newcastle defenders called for cover that never came.If there had been an equaliser, it looked like coming four minutes later from the head of Trifunovic, but the striker put Cameron Watson’s cross into Vukovic’s hands.

Newcastle Jets crash to open up W-League semi-finals race
~CONTENTS~
Newcastle Jets’ hopes of ending their long drought from the W-League semi-finals suffered a potentially mortal blow as the bottom-placed Melbourne Victory secured an unexpected 1-0 win at Hunter Stadium on Sunday.Bar raised by Melbourne City as promise of women's football is highlighted | Joe Gorman Read moreNatasha Dowie scored the lone goal with a spectacular lofted effort from distance just 13 minutes into the contest. Both sides created several goal-scoring opportunities but the Jets, who have averaged less than a goal a game this season, again suffered from a lack of firepower in front of goal.Stumbling W-League giants Brisbane Roar took full advantage, forcing their way back into semi-final contention with a stunning opening-half performance setting up a 3-1 win over Adelaide United. Emily Gielnik scored twice in the first period either side of a Kirsty Yallop strike, as the two-time champions moved into a three-way share of fourth alongside Adelaide and the Jets.The home side claimed a late consolation goal via the boot of American defender Abby Dahlkemper. Brisbane, however, were always in control of the contest and they eased to a second win in three outings, with their mid-season five-match winless streak now a distant memory.Table-topping Melbourne City celebrated last weekend’s premiership win with yet another one-sided victory; this time 4-0 over Western Sydney Wanderers. Australia captain Lisa De Vanna was rested from the match as an injury precaution, leaving Kim Little to impress once again. The Scottish attacking midfielder scored twice in the first half to be the league’s second top scorer behind teammate Larissa Crummer. Teenager Beattie Goad and substitute Marianna Tabain also netted in the second half as City hit four goals for the seventh time in just 11 matches.There was bad news for Perth Glory on Saturday evening as they slipped to a 2-0 home defeat against Canberra United, with the match overshadowed by a broken collarbone suffered by star recruit Caitlin Foord. The Matildas’ first-choice fullback underwent surgery on Sunday leaving her in doubt for the national team’s Rio Olympic qualifiers at the end of February.

Jürgen Klopp wary of Liverpool’s defensive frailty before Stoke match
~~AUTHOR~~
Andy Hunter
~CONTENTS~
Jürgen Klopp struggled for the English word he wanted to describe Liverpool’s defending against West Ham United – passive – and possibly because it is not one associated with his teams. There was no confusion over his message, however, as the Liverpool manager insisted a place in the Capital One Cup final will be jeopardised by another supine show at Stoke City.Geoff Cameron free to face Liverpool after Stoke win red card appeal Read moreKlopp has several problems to contend with going into Tuesday’s first leg at the Britannia Stadium, not least an injury list that is growing at the wrong time. Liverpool’s return of 22 goals is the lowest in the club’s history after 20 league games and Christian Benteke is the only recognised striker fit and available. Attempts to repair Daniel Sturridge for the remainder of the campaign, by giving the striker a training programme usually designed for pre-season, have been interrupted by minor injury setbacks, while lapses in concentration continue to undermine Klopp’s quest for consistency.But he accepts no excuses for the defensive vulnerabilities that predate his arrival as the manager, and reappeared when Michail Antonio headed West Ham towards a 2-0 victory on Saturday.“We were passive in this moment and that is never good in football, never good in life,” Klopp said. “When Alberto [Moreno] goes down it is a foul but we still had 10 players closer to our goal than the player who scored in the end. We have an issue with crosses; before we had an issue with set plays. It is always a ball in the air. As long as the ball is on the ground most of the time we handle it. When the ball is in the air we have some problems with the goals we concede.“We know this. We have to solve this. We are really serious in our analysis, clear in our words. No excuses. We have to change for sure. One of the biggest rules in football is that you have to prevent crosses because when the ball is in the air it is 50-50. That is not a good ratio. We have to do better. Talking is easy, changing is more difficult but nevertheless we have to do it.”Klopp is not dealing with only one major flaw. Since putting six past Southampton in last month’s quarter-final Liverpool have scored only once in five away matches – Benteke’s winner at Sunderland – with the loss of Sturridge, Danny Ings and Divock Origi to injury only part of the problem as far as the manager is concerned.Asked to explain Liverpool’s historic goalscoring low in the league, Klopp replied: “First of all, sorry.” He elaborated: “The mother of all goals is the opportunity, the chance, so we have to have them and then you have to take them. We need to be more concentrated, be more greedy, be more disciplined, be more everything.“There are a lot of goals scored from set pieces in the Premier League, not only against us, and we’ve been in positions to score from these situations and we have to do this more often.Daniel Sturridge suffers further injury setback at Liverpool Read more“We aren’t in situations enough but we are often in situations where we can score goals and we don’t use them. You need confidence. We made goals in several games – six against Southampton and things like this – so we know where the goal is, that’s the good thing. But we have things to work on. We have big problems with injuries with the strikers so we have to work, it’s not dreamland. We know the numbers and it’s not good but we can do better.”Klopp claimed Mark Hughes was doing “a brilliant job” at the Britannia and that he knew more about Stoke than any other Premier League opponent because of their strong former Bundesliga contingent, who include Marko Arnautovic, Mame Biram Diouf, Ibrahim Afellay, Joselu, Xherdan Shaqiri and Philipp Wollscheid.The learning process continues at Liverpool and the former Borussia Dortmund coach insists his anger was not only reserved for his players at West Ham.“I felt responsible at West Ham, that’s how I am,” Klopp said. “I always feel much more responsible for defeats than for victories because I think about what I should have done differently before a game to avoid situations like that around the West Ham goals. It is easy for a manager to say: ‘I cannot score the goals or defend the goals’ – that is only part of the truth. If it was the whole truth then why are we so well paid? We have to be responsible for the common things. It is easy to say: ‘But I told the players to do this, this and this.’ Yes, I told the players but maybe not before the game against West Ham and now I have to think about whether I am telling them too often or not often enough.”

Stoke’s attacking trident ready to reward Mark Hughes’s bravery
~~AUTHOR~~
Jamie Jackson
~CONTENTS~
The dazzling Bojan Krkic-Xherdan Shaqiri-Marko Arnautovic axis at the front of Stoke City has already befuddled Manchester City and Manchester United and next could be Liverpool in the Capital One Cup semi-final.Stoke’s attacking trident ready to reward Mark Hughes’s bravery Read moreThe reward for victory over two legs for the Stoke side spearheaded by the trio is a trip to Wembley for February’s final, where they would face either City or Everton, and according to their manager, Mark Hughes, Tuesday’s first leg at the Britannia Stadium offers his shrewdly assembled team a chance to take the tie away from Liverpool.Stoke have only one major honour to their name – the 1972 incarnation of this competition – compared with Liverpool’s impressive 41, yet given the faltering start to Jürgen Klopp’s tenure at Anfield, and the progress Stoke have made under Hughes, the Welshman is bullish.“Yes, we feel there’s an opportunity if we play well,” he says. “We’ve come up against Man United, Man City and Chelsea and got positive results – there is a possibility we could take the tie away from Liverpool in the first instance.”Chelsea have been beaten twice, once in the fourth round, on penalties, in late October, and the following week in the Premier League. Those victories came when Hughes was still selecting Jonathan Walters as an orthodox centre-forward. So to knock out Liverpool and go on to claim a second trophy in Stoke’s history would be a near-instant dividend for Hughes, with the manager being “brave” just a month ago when deciding to field Krkic, Shaqiri and Arnautovic for the first time as a front three.That was when City were taken apart 2-0 at the Britannia Stadium in a match that could have ended 6-0. Krkic, Shaqiri and Arnautovic were the headline acts. They had Manuel Pellegrini’s team looking amateurish during an exhibition of attacking play, with Arnautovic scoring both goals. Later, Hughes said he had to summon the courage to ask the Spaniard, Swiss and Austrian to combine in a system that has Arnautovic as a false No9 who interchanges with Krkic and Shaqiri.As with the defeat of City, when United were beaten 2-0 on Boxing Day – again at the Britannia – the trio proved irresistible, with Krkic and Arnautovic both scoring. Of Stoke’s 21 league goals Krkic, Shaqiri and Arnautovic (who also scored the winner against Chelsea) have contributed 14 between them – and they can also boast seven assists.Since the victory over City, Hughes has stuck with them as a front three. There followed a goalless draw with West Ham United, a 2-1 defeat to Crystal Palace, wins over United and Everton (4-3), and Saturday’s 2-1 defeat at West Bromwich Albion, though Jonny Evans late clincher came after Geoff Cameron was sent off on 83 minutes. Stoke’s appeal against the dismissal proved successful on Monday and the midfielder is free to face Liverpool.Stoke are 10th in the league on 29 points, three more than at the corresponding point of last season, and only one behind Liverpool. Hughes has also seen enough to believe Krkic, Shaqiri and Arnautovic can make Stoke a serious top-flight proposition.“Yes I think it’s something that is exciting and positive for us,” he says. “There are going to be some games such as West Brom where we are not quite as dynamic in terms of getting on the ball or playing out from the back. As a consequence we couldn’t release the three higher up the pitch as we like to do.“There will be occasions when it doesn’t function quite as well as you would like but in the most part in almost every game we have created chances and against good teams we’ve been able to take them as well. It is a good option – it won’t be our only one but it is good we can mix it up.“ They are game changers and all the top sides have game changers. The teams just below the elite teams have game changers in their ranks and we certainly have. We have players who can turn games. In big games, you need your big players to perform and hopefully they will do that.”Hughes is relaxed about reports linking Krkic and Arnautovic with moves in the transfer window. “Speculation will increase. I expect that but I’m not worried about losing anyone,” he says.Stoke’s strengths extend throughout their team, with the captain Ryan Shawcross leading a robust defence usually complemented by three of Glenn Whelan, Cameron, Charlie Adam, Marco van Ginkel and Ibrahim Afellay.“We have power, we have technical ability and we have craft as well which you need,” Hughes says. “A lot of things that you need to change games we have. We are strong for most part at the back as well.”Geoff Cameron free to face Liverpool after Stoke win red card appeal Read moreA playing career laden with silverware has left Hughes hungry for a first trophy as a manager. He took Blackburn Rovers to three semi-finals between 2004 and 2008, and is keen for Stoke to emulate the triumphant 1972 side of Gordon Banks, George Eastham and Jimmy Greenhoff.“Games and semi-finals I’ve been involved in as a player: you have to make sure you get your job done and make it happen for the team and as individuals,” he says. “It’s a competition which has great significance. It’s the only major trophy the club has won. It’s been a long time since we’ve done that. If we could overcome a very good Liverpool side and get to the final that would be something. The challenge is there for us. We’ve got to grab it.”Klopp’s misfiring Liverpool visit Stoke on a forecasted wet and windy evening for a first leg that offers Hughes’s team a golden opportunity to seize the initiative. Do so and they could return to Wembley five years after losing the FA Cup final to Manchester City. That was under Tony Pulis – this is now a very different Stoke outfit.

Sam Allardyce critical of ‘diabolical’ midweek Premier League schedule
~~AUTHOR~~
Louise Taylor
~CONTENTS~
Sam Allardyce has accused the Premier League of putting players’ health at risk and devaluing the FA Cup by staging a full programme of fixtures next Tuesday and Wednesday. In a fierce attack Sunderland’s manager described the scheduling as “diabolical” and said the league was “destroying” the game. He is convinced many top-tier clubs will field weakened teams in this weekend’s third-round ties to preserve fatigued players for matches a few days later.“Of course I’m going to make changes for our Cup tie at Arsenal on Saturday,” said Allardyce, who believes the glut of matches in late December and early January makes footballers more vulnerable to potentially serious injury. “If the Premier League decides to put a stupid fixture midweek when they don’t bloody need to, then I haven’t got much choice.“It’s diabolical. We’re flogging the lads. There are more and more injuries every year but it’s completely ignored by the Premier League. It’s unbelievable. If you want us to respect the FA Cup, don’t put Premier League fixtures in the midweek just after new year. Don’t give me stick when I change the side at Arsenal. Give the Premier League stick, not the managers.”   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest  Sam Allardyce expresses his relief after Sunderland’s victory over Aston Villa last Saturday.He is further aggrieved by the league having agreed to a request from Swansea to move their game against Sunderland at the Liberty Stadium from next Tuesday, 12 January, to the following day.Whereas this offers Swansea an extra day to recover from a Cup tie at Oxford on Sunday it reduces Sunderland’s rest period before another league game at Tottenham on Saturday lunchtime.Allardyce believes the decision could jeopardise his side’s survival chances. “Making me play Wednesday and Saturday rather than Tuesday and Saturday is making it harder for me to get Premier League points,” he said. “With having three away games in succession we’ve got around 2,000 miles of travel and the lunchtime kick-off means we’ve less than three days recovery for Tottenham.”Swansea had the game switched on the grounds they needed more than 48 hours to recover from their Cup trip. “Swansea probably won’t play their best team at Oxford, they’re likely to make changes,” Allardyce countered. “But I’m not annoyed with Swansea, I’m annoyed with the Premier League.”There is a suspicion that a round of midweek games at a time when the rest of Europe is on a winter break suits Premier League executives nicely because of its particular appeal to overseas broadcasters offering lucrative television rights packages.Jermain Defoe revels as lone ranger and gives Sunderland hope of better times Read more“It would be very sad if the Premier League had put in midweek fixtures next week for that reason, because we get enough money as it is,” Allardyce said. “How much more money do we need, for God’s sake? It’s a game to be enjoyed, not a game to be destroyed and we destroy the game by asking the players to do too much in this period. The Premier League have the facts, they’ve had them for years. The game gets ever quicker, you get more and more injuries in this period and everybody at that level just ignores it.”Sunderland have complained to the Premier League about the Swansea game’s rescheduling but the protest fell on deaf ears. “They’ve described our complaint as frivolous,” Allardyce said. “They don’t look at the facts properly. To dismiss our appeal was totally and utterly wrong by Mr Scudamore [the Premier League’s chief executive]. Richard Scudamore has my number and he can ring me up any time he wants to tell me why he agreed the change. But he won’t call.”Allardyce is also cynical about an offer from Swansea to compensate around 300 Sunderland fans who had booked trips to Wales before the date change. “The Premier League told the fans they’ll get their expenses back,” said Allardyce. “But what a load of bollocks. I’m concerned with the fans who have booked their travel up and spent their money; will they get all of that back or won’t they?”Anxious not to become embroiled in a slanging match with Sunderland’s manager, the Premier League declined to respond to Allardyce’s comments but it has confirmed Swansea have guaranteed to cover non-refundable travel and accommodation costs incurred by away supporters who booked in advance of the game being put back. Ticket outlay will also be covered for anyone no longer able to attend.If it is not uncommon for midweek league games to be rearranged in instances when one club has had a Sunday Cup tie, it remains relatively rare for there to be a top-flight Tuesday/Wednesday programme immediately after the FA Cup’s third round – the last time this happened was in 2004.This season the pressures of a congested domestic and European programme before Euro 2016 are understood to have made its presence unavoidable by fixture compilers.

No shock Rafael Benítez was sacked but odd it took Real Madrid so long

The banner was unfurled four minutes into the game and it was huge, stretching all the way along the stand on Calle Doctor Juan Reglá, big black letters on a white sheet. Rafael Benítez’s face was drawn at one end, smiling. “Rafa,” the message said, “you gave us the best days of our lives. Thank you.” As the fans held it up, they chanted his name and briefly he raised his hand. The supporters were on his side this time; the problem was that they were not Real Madrid’s fans; they were Valencia’s. Whistled at the Santiago Bernabéu, he was welcomed at Mestalla.Rafael Benítez sacked by Real Madrid with Zinedine Zidane taking over Read moreHe was not welcome back in Madrid. On Tuesday Madrid will hold their annual open-doors training session, attended by supporters. Benítez could well have faced more abuse there but as it turns out, he will not be there at all. By Monday evening the inevitable had finally happened: Benítez was no longer manager of Real Madrid. The surprise was that it had taken this long and that a draw, not a defeat, had been enough for them to end it. Barely a week after Florentino Pérez insisted that Benítez would not be sacked, he was sacked. The contrast with the night before was eloquent.Benítez had not sat on the bench at Mestalla since May 2004. He returned for the first time last night to the club he joined in 2001, now as an opponent. Back then, a board member mistook him for a bullfighter when he arrived – “Well,” remembered the sporting director Javier Subirats, summing it up, “some board members don’t know anything about football” – and halfway through his first season he had been on the verge of the sack, surviving with a 3-2 win against Espanyol at Montjuïc. But five months later they had won an unlikely league title. The best days of their life? Probably.Alongside the banner on Sunday was a picture of the two league titles and the Uefa Cup Valencia won in three years under Benítez. They had not previously won the league in 31 years and they have not won it in the decade since. A lot has happened here since he left for Liverpool. His right-back is coach of the B team; his centre-back has been coach of the first team, and so have 12 others. There have been nine presidents, one of whom ended up in court against his captain. Time has not diminished what he did. It has underlined it.Real Madrid sack Benítez and Zidane takes over – as it happened Read moreBenítez was “heavy-going”, his Valencia players admit. He banned paella and ice cream and drills went on and on. His first game was in August 2001 when Valencia beat Real Madrid, swarming all over them, racing round the pitch “like motorbikes” in David Albelda’s words. It was Zinedine Zidane’s debut and afterwards the Frenchman asked, bewildered: “Will it always be like this?” When they met at the Bernabéu, a ludicrous penalty was given to Raúl and Benítez moaned: “You have to do twice as much here.” But still he brought the galácticos down to earth. A decade on he is their manager. Well, he was.On Sunday Benítez returned, in charge of the club that Valencia fans hate most, the one that he had defeated and now seemed to be defeating him. How much longer he would be there no one really knew then. Get the wrong result and the answer would be: not long at all. It often feels as if his press conferences take place in Punxsutawney, “will you get sacked if you lose?” playing on a loop. “I hope you’re asking me that question for two or three years,” he replied on Saturday, which was a fairly grim hope. Twenty-four hours later, after the 2-2 draw at Valencia, one reporter began: “So, here we are again …”“It’s like I always say …” Benítez said. And it was.Facing Valencia was an opportunity but it was also an obligation. For the third time in four league games Barcelona had drawn, this time a 0-0 at Espanyol. And, if Atlético’s late winner against Levante meant that Madrid could not go top, a victory would put them level with Barcelona (having played a game more), just two points behind the new leaders, Atlético. Win and Benítez would stay in a job; lose, they said, and he would not. And Valencia were determined for him to lose. “The gratitude will last a minute and then it’s over,” Gary Neville had warned. Draw and, well, here we are again … Only this time was the last time.Asked if he feared for his job (again), Benítez insisted: “That is a question that only makes sense if you only look at the result … we saw a great Madrid; there were more things to praise than to criticise.” But the question did make sense; it also confirmed what Benítez must have always known: the assurances made to him were worthless.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Paco Alcacer places the late equaliser past Real Madrid’s Keylor Navas. Photograph: Biel Alino/EPASunday night’s 2-2 draw was a frantic, exciting game that came in pairs. Valencia got the penalty that levelled it immediately after Gareth Bale should have had a penalty at the other end; when Mateo Kovacic was sent off, leaving Madrid with 10 men, it came as Valencia broke after Ronaldo had gone down in the area; Bale’s goal to put Madrid into the lead was followed 71 seconds later by Paco Alcácer heading Valencia level again. In the very last minute, Álvaro Negredo could, and should, have won it … and so could Bale have done. “They escaped alive!” claimed the Valencian paper Super Deporte. “We could have won,” said Neville. “And lost.”That went for both of them. As Madrid’s players celebrated the second goal in the 83rd minute, Benítez approached them on the touchline and gestured for them to remain compact; this was time for seriousness, not celebration. A man down but a goal up with seven minutes to go, he knew better than anyone how important this win was: don’t let it slip. Seconds later they had done exactly that. “All you can do is lament that,” he said. At that point he still believed that a draw might be sufficient. It was not.A draw at Valencia is no disgrace, still less with 10 men. Barcelona drew at Mestalla and Valencia did not lose a single league game there in 2015; it was defeat there that began Madrid’s slide last season. The point was perhaps a good one and Benítez was entitled to think that he might have emerged strengthened from it but he knew that the sentence had already been passed down.Zinedine Zidane back in Real Madrid spotlight after spell in the wings Read moreOn Saturday it seemed that he had perhaps sensed as much; this time his discourse changed. No longer his master’s voice, he instead pointed the finger at the structure of the squad – and at the members of his squad too.In an analysis that described the “eminently attacking nature” of Madrid’s squad as their “problem”, an unusually blunt assessment that cannot have pleased the board, Benítez had talked about players of casta and raza, spirit and leadership. Players like Alfredo Di Stéfano – who, for all his talent, famously told Amancio Amaro “you have to sweat to earn [this shirt], sunshine” – José Antonio Camacho, Juanito, and Pirri, the man who played one game in 1975 with a broken jaw. Against Valencia Benítez left out James Rodríguez and Isco and there was spirit, as Sergio Ramos insisted. There was certainly merit in going 2-1 up with 10 men.Not everyone agreed, though: this was, after all, not just one game. It was another bullet wasted, another train they had failed to catch, another opportunity gone. Barcelona had handed them the chance to close the gap and they had not taken it. Some of the difficulties they faced were familiar ones, too: Valencia often ran through the midfield unchallenged, led by the superb André Gomes. “Carry on with this?” asked Tomas Guasch in Marca. “Madrid can win lose or draw but never like this … and it’s not the first time.” If that judgment was harsh, so was a colleague’s. “Who has Benítez drawn against?” asked Josevi Hernáez, before listing the teams he has drawn against.Madrid could have won this but they did not. And that was familiar too: 17 points have slipped away from them in the opening 18 weeks of the season. Another big game had ended without them taking all three points. Victories against most teams are taken as read, barely given any value at all. Against Barcelona, Sevilla, Atlético, Villarreal, Valencia, Madrid have won none. Ronaldo’s goals provide some measure of their difficulties against the better sides: he has scored 25 this season, more than anyone else, but none of them against Athletic (whom Madrid did beat), Atlético, PSG (in two matches), Sevilla, Barcelona, Villarreal or Valencia.“Benítez is not the problem, Benítez is the solution,” the president Florentino Pérez said. That is what he said publicly, anyway. Privately he was briefing otherwise. He was not convinced by the alternatives but knew that sacking his manager left him exposed. Resisting it, though, became impossible and he had not been certain about Benítez almost from the start. The players were even less enamoured; the situation had become unsustainable. Any peace was always going to be precarious. Some players had already been told not to worry; he will not be there for long. A win would only have postponed the inevitable. A draw, too, might have done but finally the decision was made.On Sunday night the players’ backing of Benítez, a manager with whom few really connected, was not exactly wholehearted. It was, rather, an invitation to sack him. On MondayOnMonday Pérez took that up. “Benítez has crédito but it does not depend on us,” added Ramos. “Obviously, whichever manager is here will always have the trust of the players.” “We are with the manager but we are not the ones who make decisions,” Marcelo added. Not directly, no. The president does that. And on Monday on Monday he did.Talking points • Partey time! The clock ticked down and Atlético could not find away through until Thomas Partey picked the ball up, burst through the middle, play exactly tee one two that Levante’s coaching staff had told the squad he plays, and finally get the only goal of the game. It took Atlético top of the table, two points ahead of Barcelona.• Palo was the word: a post, a stick, a beating. Barcelona hit the post and Espanyol hit Barcelona.• They were lucky with the refereeing but that’s five wins in a row now for Villarreal, who are looking good for a Champions League place and very good indeed for a Europa League slot. They’re six ahead of Athletic, 10 ahead of Sevilla and 13 ahead of Valencia.• Another week, another Paco Jémez rant. And, frankly, he seems to be losing it a bit. “The club made a mistake; first of all, with me,” he said after his team’s 2-2 draw with Real Sociedad, a draw that leaves them in the relegation still. “The goals show clearly that we are not of a first division level. The club is wrong with us; we cannot go on letting in goals like this. Its a haemorrhage and we’re bleeding dry.”• When Valencia won the penalty against Madrid at the weekend, André Gomes started celebrating as if they had already scored. This time, he was right, but that’s always a risk, and all the more so this season. Amrabat’s miss for Málaga on Saturday night means that 17 of 48 penalties have not been scored this season. At 36%, that’s the worst average for over 50 years.Gary Neville says he wants to stay on as Valencia manager Read more• So James says he was scared that the police car following him at 200km/h was actually a kidnapping and that’s why they were chasing him/ But also that he didn’t hear the siren or the requests for him to pull over because he had the music on so loud. What was he listening to? The Benny Hill theme?• There were lots of Barcelona fans complaining about the difference between the way that Espanyol approach their games with Madrid and their games with Barcelona following a 0-0 draw in the Catalan derby on Saturday night. Which pretty much amounts to complaining at the fact that it was a derby. And, anyway, Espanyol have taken exactly the same number of points from Madrid as they have from Barcelona since the turn of the century. (And that’s not many). That said, it was pretty bad at times, if not quite as bad as some made out and at least it felt like a real derby again, unlike last year. “Cornella became Stalingrad,” said AS. Neymar, in particular, took some punishment. Speaking of punishment, for a long time referee González González seemed to have decided he wasn’t going to hand out any at all. In exaggerated summary: Barcelona hit the post and Espanyol hit Barcelona.Results: Espanyol 0-0 Barcelona, Atlético 1-0 Levante, Málaga 2-0 Celta, Rayo 2-2 Real Sociedad, Betis 0-4 Eibar, Granada 2-1 Sevilla, Deportivo 1-2 Villarreal, Athletic 2-2 Las Palmas, Valencia 2-2 Real Madrid, Sporting-Getafe, Monday night.

Zinedine Zidane back in Real Madrid spotlight after spell in the wings
~~AUTHOR~~
James Riach
~CONTENTS~
Rarely will a coach begin a career amid such intrigue. If Gary Neville’s appointment at Valencia caused a stir, Zinedine Zidane’s at Real Madrid is a seismic, if not entirely unexpected, development.Rafael Benítez sacked by Real Madrid with Zinedine Zidane taking over Read moreThe man who could do things with a football that others only dream of has been fast-tracked to the coaching zenith, replacing Rafa Benítez as Madrid manager despite a lack of experience. It is certainly a risk, for both club and coach, but one too enticing for each to ignore.Zidane is a hero at Madrid, as he is at Juventus, Bordeaux and across France. He is accustomed to pressure, used to carrying the hopes of thousands and delivering when it counts. The art of getting others to deliver for you, though, is something else altogether.It is a significant risk in that things may not work out as intended, if Zidane struggles to bring success to the Bernabéu and rein in Barcelona and Atlético Madrid. It would be sad to see this titan felled by Florentino Pérez at some point in the future but perhaps he is held in such high regard by the club that his reverential status will remain intact whatever happens to the team under his watch. He has already targeted one trophy this season.Zidane was at the peak of his club powers in a white shirt – winning the Spanish title and Champions League between 2001 and 2006, even if the Galácticos were not an entirely dominant force – and has spent much of his life in Madrid, five years as a player and later as a director, assistant and reserve coach.Maybe he is the ideal man to morph a team of stars into a winning force, having shone the brightest in a team of stars himself. If anyone can walk into a dressing room and demand the respect of Cristiano Ronaldo and company, it is Zidane.Zinedine Zidane's career at Real Madrid – in pictures Read moreIt appears that he has been primed to take this role for some time. When Zidane retired from playing after leading France to the World Cup final in 2006 – player of the tournament in Germany despite his infamous denouement – the midfielder did not intend to move into coaching. Now, however, he finds himself in one of the biggest jobs there is.His desire to coach manifested itself only years later but, since becoming a special adviser to Madrid’s first team in 2010, his influence at the club has grown. He convinced the French centre-half Raphaël Varane to join from Lens despite interest from Manchester United, becoming the director of football and later an assistant under Carlo Ancelotti, as Madrid won the Champions League – La Decima – under the Italian.Zidane was then appointed coach of Real Madrid’s Castilla “B” team, gaining his Uefa Pro Licence in May 2015. The side are currently second in Segunda B. In 2014 the 43-year-old was handed a three-month coaching ban following a complaint from Spain’s national coaching centre because he did not hold the requisite qualifications, but the suspension was soon lifted by a Spanish court. When discussing his coaching opportunities in March last year, he said: “I’ve got time, I’m learning. I did not become the player I was in two years – it’s the same in coaching.”No shock Rafael Benítez was sacked but odd it took Real Madrid so long | Sid Lowe Read moreAlthough he will undoubtedly have to learn quickly, Zidane has certainly not received a hospital pass of the sort he used to kill dead without a second thought. Madrid are third in La Liga, four points off the top, and have scored comfortably more goals than anyone in the division. Last month they beat Rayo Vallecano 10-2. They also have a last-16 tie in the Champions League next month against Roma.However, whereas his three predecessors in the position – Benítez, Carlo Ancelotti and José Mourinho – have six European Cups between them as coaches, Zidane has his reputation, a romantic allure and the brief experience he has garnered with the reserves. But his appointment may earn some favour for Pérez among supporters, with some comparing Madrid’s decision to look within as similar to Barcelona’s appointment of Pep Guardiola in 2008 after a spell honing coaching skills with the reserves.As the announcement was made on Monday evening, Zidane looked calm and hungry for the task. Pérez told him: “I know that for you the word ‘impossible’ doesn’t exist.”

~CONTENTS~
Zinedine Zidane has become the manager of Real Madrid after the club’s president, Florentino Pérez, announced the sacking of Rafael Benítez at the Bernabéu on Monday night after exactly seven months in charge. The decision to replace Benítez has left Gareth Bale very unhappy and the Welshman may consider his options in the summer.Zinedine Zidane back in the Real Madrid spotlight after spell in the wings Read moreThe Spaniard, who has difficult relationships with some of the players, was particularly close to Bale and the 26-year-old will not be short of suitors should he decide the time is right to leave Spain at the end of the season, three years after his €100m (£85.2m) move to the Bernabéu.Zidane was briefly presented to the press after Pérez offered a two-sentence statement confirming the board had agreed to “resolve” Benítez’s contract that had two more seasons left to run. The Spaniard was not at the stadium and sources close to him claimed he had not been informed of the decision and only on Monday morning he was still being assured by the club’s chief executive, José Ángel Sánchez, that his job was safe.It was only 13 days ago that Pérez told a Spanish radio station Benítez was not a “problem” but the “solution” and six weeks since he called a press conference to deny reports he was planning to sack the manager, instead blaming the media for seeking to “destabilise” the club. “Rafa has just started his work; let him work. He needs time,” Pérez said then.“We have taken a difficult decision, especially for me, to resolve Rafa Benítez’s contract,” Pérez said on Monday. “He is a great professional and a magnificent person and we wish to express our gratitude for the work he has done over these months.”Zinedine Zidane's career at Real Madrid – in pictures Read moreThat was all Pérez had to say about Benítez and he did not allow questions from a packed press conference set up in the VIP area of the stadium. There were no explanations for the sacking nor any more information offered as to the agreement reached to rescind his contract, or indeed if an agreement had been reached with the former Liverpool manager.Without pausing, Pérez turned to Zinedine Zidane, who had walked into the room before him accompanied by his family and was sitting in the front row. Benítez was quickly forgotten, no longer mentioned. Zidane is the 15th manager Real Madrid have had since 2003.“I want to announce we have decided to name Zinedine Zidane as our new coach. He is without doubt one of the greatest figures in the history of football,” Pérez said. “He knows better than anyone what it means to be at the head of Madrid’s first team squad. He knows how hard this challenge is but how exciting it is too.“He knows a lot of the players too from the 10th [European Cup] in Lisbon [when Zidane was assistant to Carlo Ancelotti],” Pérez continued. “He has always taken on the greatest challenges in football with talent and effort.”Turning to Zidane, Pérez said: “This is your stadium and your club and you have all our confidence and trust to make the fans excited once more. It makes me proud because I know that for you the word impossible does not exist.”In total he had spoken for a minute and a half and he then made way for Zidane who gave a short, timid speech in which he said that “work begins tomorrow”. He will be presented at the Bernabéu, alongside the director of institutional relations, Emilio Butragueño.It is no shock Rafael Benítez was sacked, but odd it took Real Madrid so long Read moreMadrid are third in La Liga, two points behind Barcelona and four behind Atlético. A 2-2 draw against Valencia on Sunday night in which neither James Rodríguez nor Isco played was Benítez’s final game.Pérez had been unconvinced by Benítez for some time but was also unsure about handing the first team job to Zidane mid-season and had been thinking over this decision for a while, despite his public defence of Benítez.Zidane played 108 times for France and scored 31 goals, including two in the 3-0 win over Brazil in the 1998 World Cup final. He completed his full licence badges in the summer and has spent just over a year in charge of Real Madrid Castilla, the club’s B team, who are second in the second division B, Group II. The 43-year-old will bring his backroom staff with him.The former Real Madrid winger Santiago Solari will not be part of Zidane’s staff, despite reports suggesting he would join him.

Although the fee is undisclosed it is understood an offer around £3.75m led to the 19-year-old leaving St Andrew’s.The January transfer window opened only on Saturday but Leicester – second in the Premier League, two points behind Arsenal – have moved quickly to follow up their summer interest in the winger.Leicester’s Jamie Vardy to miss one match as he undergoes groin surgery Read moreGray, who has signed a four-and-a-half-year contract, told Leicester’s website: “It’s been my dream to play in the Premier League since I started playing football so I’m very happy to join the club. It’s a great club. The facilities are great and for a player like me it’s an ideal place for me to improve. Meeting all the staff here, it seems like a nice family place, so I think that’s perfect for me.“You can see how well the team has been doing this year and I watch a lot of football so I can see that the way Leicester City play suits my style. I only hear good things about Leicester and I’m looking forward to starting.”During the summer transfer window Leicester triggered a release clause in Gray’s contract but he decided to remain at Birmingham.Gray was left out of the Birmingham squad for their Championship game at home to Brentford on Saturday and underwent a medical before Leicester’s game against Bournemouth, who were also interested in the England Under-20 international and had several bids turned down in the summer.He will train with Leicester for the first time on Tuesday and could go straight into the squad for their FA Cup third-round tie against Tottenham at White Hart Lane on Sunday.

The Arsenal double winner John Roberts has died at the age of 69. The Wales defender played for Swansea and Northampton before joining Arsenal in 1969 and spent more than three years at Highbury.Roberts featured 18 times during Arsenal’s historic 1970-71 campaign when they became only the second team in the modern era to complete the league and FA Cup double, although he did not play in the cup final.In all, Roberts made 81 appearances for Arsenal before joining their First Division rivals Birmingham in 1972. He went on to play for Wrexham and Hull before retiring in the early 1980s.Born in the village of Abercynon in the Cynon Valley, Roberts won 22 caps and was part of the Wales squad that reached the quarter-finals of the 1976 European Championship.“Everyone at Arsenal was saddened to hear of the death of John Roberts,” said a statement on the club’s website. “The thoughts of everyone at Arsenal are with John’s family and friends.”

Geoff Cameron free to face Liverpool after Stoke win red card appeal
~CONTENTS~
Geoff Cameron is free to face Liverpool in Stoke’s Capital One Cup semi-final, first leg against Liverpool on Tuesday after the club were successful in their appeal against the red card the midfielder received in the defeat by West Bromwich Albion on Saturday.Cameron was facing a three-match suspension having been sent off for violent conduct by Lee Mason after pushing Claudio Yacob in the back of the neck during Stoke’s 2-1 defeat at The Hawthorns.Stoke said on Monday they were appealing and a subsequent statement from the Football Association said: “Geoff Cameron has had his three-match suspension withdrawn with immediate effect after his wrongful dismissal claim was successful.“An Independent Regulatory Commission found that the match referee had made an obvious error in dismissing the Stoke City player for violent conduct during the game against West Bromwich Albion on Saturday.”

Nothing too intensive | The Fiver

~CONTENTS~
THESE THREE WORDSIn vino veritas? Goats don’t shave? I love you? Haters gonna hate? Do not disturb? Who wants pizza? Mange tout Rodney? Let’s get drunk? Close the gate? That was terrible? You lazy gits? When Liverpool manager Jürgen Klopp refused to elaborate on the three words he’d said to his players after they had their collective backside handed to them by West Ham on Saturday, the Fiver couldn’t have been more pleased.Let’s be honest: we have no interest in writing the first tea-timely football email of the new year and you’ve no interest in reading it, so it’s always nice when an obliging manager gives us the opportunity to pad out our opening paragraph with some nonsensical waffle that will pass as humour until we’ve all eased our way back into the dreary post-Christmas routine. Y’know, when we still have no interest in writing the Fiver, but you look forward to the reassuring squelching noise that signals its daily slither into your inbox. Oh look, 172 words and one number already and we’ve yet to mention his press conference.Yes, his press conference in which the Liverpool manager doesn’t appear to have elaborated on the content of the three-word conference he almost certainly had with his players on Saturday about their reluctance to press. Speaking before his side’s Rumbelows Cup semi-final first leg against Stoke tomorrow night, the Kloppster insisted the tournament is important. “We have to go for it,” he said. “Our target is to win it. We have issues with crosses. Before that we had issues with set pieces. We need to solve that. We’ve been clear with the words.”Talking about the need to react to defeats in the right way, Klopp added that it was important to react to defeats in the right way. “You have to react to defeats in the right way,” he said. “We don’t have six, seven, eight players to change. We have to react to the impact the last game had on the players and decide. We will only have a light session today. Nothing too intensive.” Much like the session they had against West Ham on Saturday, then. Three words: nothing too intensive.QUOTE OF THE DAY“We are satisfied [with the kit deal] even if the current playing style of Man United is not exactly what we want to see” – Adidas chief suit Herbert Hainer joins the chorus of bored Old Trafford regulars in lamenting the fact that the three stripes on the Manchester United kit don’t move around a bit quicker.

Daniel Sturridge suffers further injury setback at Liverpool
~~AUTHOR~~
Andy Hunter
~CONTENTS~
Liverpool’s attempt to get Daniel Sturridge fit for the rest of the season with a specialised training routine has been disrupted by injury, Jürgen Klopp has revealed.Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s action Read moreThe England international was put on an individual training programme after suffering a hamstring strain against Newcastle United on 6 December – his third injury since Klopp became Liverpool manager. Sturridge declared himself “back in training and good to go” following the Boxing Day win over Leicester City and Klopp had hoped the striker would be available for the Premier League game at West Ham United, which Liverpool lost 2-0.However, despite the recent positive updates, the 26-year-old has been unable to complete his training schedule without interruption and will not be considered for Tuesday’s Capital One Cup semi-final first leg at Stoke City.Klopp said: “Daniel has had some problems, not serious, but he could not make all the sessions and we had to wait a day. It is how a pre-season can be. Some little things happen and we have to handle this. It is not a row of sessions and we say: ‘Now we are here and go …’ I will pick him when he is ready, I will not hold him back. But he has not had one session with the team so he is not available.”Liverpool remain desperate for Sturridge’s quality in front of goal – their total of 22 from 20 league games is the lowest in the club’s history – but Klopp insists he must maintain a long-term view with the injury-plagued forward.He said: “What Daniel has to do at this moment is hard work to be prepared for the things we make in a football game. He has not had a complete pre-season in a long time. In pre-season we load our bodies with strength, energy, all we need for the games and then the problems start. It would be easy for me to say: ‘Come on, let’s try, we have problems, we don’t score enough goals, let’s see what will happen’ but we have to wait and be patient.”

Manchester United’s style of play criticised by chief executive of Adidas

~CONTENTS~
Manchester United’s style of play under Louis van Gaal has been criticised by the chief executive of Adidas, who signed a £750m kit sponsorship deal with the club last summer.Manchester United launch retro Adidas kit following their £750m deal Read moreUnited ended a run of eight matches without a victory with the 2-1 win over Swansea on Saturday and despite widespread criticism for a stagnant style of play, Van Gaal claimed afterwards that in their last two matches – also including the goalless draw against Chelsea – his side had adopted a riskier approach.Nonetheless, Manchester United have scored just 12 goals at home this season and Van Gaal’s position remains precarious with the club currently in fifth place and out of the Champions League. The comments made by Herbert Hainer, whose company agreed a 10-year deal to replace Nike as Manchester United’s kit sponsor last summer, will not have helped.“Business with Man United is going very well, we sell more shirts than expected,” he told the newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung. “We are satisfied … even if the current playing style of Man United is not exactly what we want to see.”

Louis van Gaal has given his Manchester United players time off following Saturday’s victory over Swansea City, which was a first win in nine games.The 2-1 victory lifted United to 33 points, three behind Tottenham Hotspur in the fourth Champions League berth. It is also the first time Van Gaal has avoided defeat to the Welsh club since he took over as manager at the start of last season.Louis van Gaal: Manchester United spurred by anger of December downfall Read moreVan Gaal praised his players’ performance given the pressure of their recent winless run and following the busy festive programme and allowed them to take Sunday and the start of the week off.After recharging their batteries, Van Gaal’s squad will return to training before Saturday’s visit of Sheffield United in the FA Cup third round.Juan Mata hopes the victory over Swansea will start a positive run of results. “Luckily, I feel that we have started 2016 with energy and that our negative streak – much longer than it should be – has been left behind,” he wrote on his blog. “Finally, we did it on Saturday against Swansea. You could see how tough it was, but I think we deserved the three points. I hope this is going to be the start of a good run of results. It depends on us.“They were a difficult opponent with good players who have made things tough for us in the last few seasons, but this time we were able to win so we start 2016 in the best possible way.“The Christmas period is gone now after three games in seven days and we have a full week ahead to prepare for the FA Cup game against Sheffield United. It’s a good time to take a break and remain calm after such a busy calendar.”

Thibaut Courtois admits Chelsea are playing for their futures under Hiddink

Gerard Meagher
~CONTENTS~
Thibaut Courtois says he and his Chelsea team-mates are playing for their futures at the club between now and the end of the season and believes a top-four finish and success in the FA Cup and Champions League is still within their grasp.Chelsea play for their futures but it is probably too late to stop purge | Barney Ronay Read moreChelsea maintained their unbeaten run under Guus Hiddink with Sunday’s 3-0 victory at Crystal Palace, showing the sort of conviction so glaringly absent under José Mourinho earlier in the season, to move into 14th in the Premier League table.The nine defeats in their opening 16 Premier League matches – a torrid run that cost Mourinho his job – mean that they remain 13 points behind fourth-placed Tottenham but Hiddink, in charge until the end of the season, still believes a top-four finish is possible.Courtois has admitted that, with a new permanent manager to be appointed in the summer who could implement a wholesale overhaul, the players’ minds have been focused. “Yes, of course,” said the Belgium goalkeeper, when asked if the team were playing for their futures. “We know we are responsible as well. We had team meetings where we said the same, that ‘OK the manager has gone but we are responsible as well – that we need to pick up our level because we are not playing good enough for a Chelsea player’. Now we are stepping up our game and that’s a good way.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest  Hiddink hails Chelsea’s 3-0 win against Crystal Palace – video“We were the ones not playing as well. Of course with a new manager some things change. Maybe with some players the mentality changed, things change. We picked up some good results, [played] some good football and then it goes again. We are still the same team that last year were the champions with Mourinho so I don’t think it’s a new change.“Obviously if you win the FA Cup or Champions League, it will be a positive. Maybe ‘success’ is a big word after not playing well until the last three or four games. But with the FA Cup or the Champions League it could still be a positive season and if we end up in the top four or top six.”While Chelsea missed out on the Premier League title during Hiddink’s first interim spell in 2009, they did lift the FA Cup and begin their campaign against Scunthorpe on Sunday before back-to-back home league matches against West Brom and Everton. Three victories would back up Courtois’s claim that Chelsea’s season is not yet a lost cause, and the Belgian revealed how Hiddink’s training methods have helped the team’s mini-revival.“The training is different. Sometimes it’s his approach in how he wants us to train, maybe sometimes it’s a bit more tactical or a bit less,” added Courtois. “There are different types of little games we play or sometimes more shooting on goal to give confidence to the strikers. Sometimes he is more outside of training, more observing. He leaves training to Steve Holland and Eddie [Newton] and he just puts in when he thinks ‘I need to explain this to the team or that to the team’. When he explains, he explains it well. Every manager has his way of working.”

Darren Fletcher urges Saido Berahino to follow Sessègnon’s lead at West Brom

The West Bromwich Albion striker Saido Berahino should follow in the footsteps of his team-mate Stéphane Sessègnon, the club’s captain Darren Fletcher said after Saturday’s last-gasp 2-1 Premier League victory over Stoke City.Jonny Evans strikes injury-time West Brom winner to down in-form Stoke Read moreSessègnon, who scored the opening goal against Stoke, appeared to have no future at the club after taking a taxi ride back to the Midlands after being omitted from the side for a 1-1 draw at Newcastle United in May.Berahino, who was the subject of four failed bids from Tottenham Hotspur during the close season, scored 20 goals in all competitions last season, but has scored only three in this campaign.“The manager has proved that if you’re not featuring but you do get a chance and play well, you will stay in the team,” Fletcher said. “That is evident with Sess. Players who are not in the team should look to that and realise if you perform when you’re given your chance the manager will stick with you.“Sess is an example to everyone. Saido is a great kid who is not in the team right now but he’s got to keep his head down because he’s a great talent and he’s got a number of years to play.”West Brom host Bristol City in the FA Cup on Saturday, followed by Premier League trips to Chelsea and Southampton.

Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s action
~~AUTHOR~~
Guardian sport
~CONTENTS~
1) Van Gaal manages to baffle, even in victoryIn Saturday’s first half against Swansea City Manchester United stank out Old Trafford. It is no exaggeration to say Louis van Gaal oversaw a display that felt poorer than the very worst of the David Moyes vintage two years ago. Not according to the Dutchman, though. United scored twice after the break to win the game yet Van Gaal said: “When we score goals and we create always chances, then it is a big difference because also, in this [press] room, a lot of journalists are saying the second half was better. I can say that it was not better.” In a particularly competitive field this goes down as one of the prime head-scratchers offered by Van Gaal. If goals and chances created are not the mark of a team playing better, then what is? Over to you, Louis. Jamie Jackson•Barry Glendenning: Van Gaal is entertaining the media, if not the fans•Paul Wilson: Martial and Rooney are Manchester United’s ghostbusters•Van Gaal: United spurred by anger of December downfall2) England talent shines through Goodison Park drawThe managers took plenty of encouragement from Tottenham’s 1-1 draw at Everton, Mauricio Pochettino from his team’s performance level, though not the outcome, and Roberto Martínez from his side’s defensive improvement having conceded seven goals in the previous two home games. Roy Hodgson must also have found grounds for optimism in his preparations for England’s European Championship campaign this summer. Dele Alli produced a stand-out display and equaliser for the visitors but the midfield control exerted by Tom Carroll and Eric Dier was also crucial to Spurs’ dominant first-half performance. Harry Kane, Ross Barkley and John Stones underlined the young talent at Hodgson’s disposal in a game where the overlooked England veteran, Gareth Barry, continued his fine recent form. “It was a really good game to see British talent,” said Martínez. “The two teams are not afraid to invest in youth and to give players the opportunities they wouldn’t get in other Premier League teams. What you are seeing now is such a variety of good young English players. You don’t get many generations like this with John Stones, Ross Barkley, Harry Kane. It is important they play in games like this because they bring experience and that experience is needed at a big tournament. The talent is clearly there.” Andy Hunter•Dele Alli’s brilliance gives Tottenham Hotspur point but Everton rally•Michael Cox: Alli wins midfield battle with Barkley       Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Dele Alli, right, the scorer of Tottenham’s goal, and Everton’s John Stones, left, were two of England’s great hopes on display at Goodison Park. Photograph: David Blunsden/ActionPlus/Corbis3) Capoue epitomises Watford’s free spiritMidfielderEtienne CapoueAppearances20Fouls Committed37Bookings4Dismissals0While Odion Ighalo and Troy Deeney share the Watford limelight Étienne Capoue has played a significant role in the shadows. It is hard to think of another player capable of elegantly nutmegging players on such a regular basis. Fernandinho became the latest victim on Saturday and, if only Capoue had finished with the shot that followed instead of firing over, Watford would have surely been celebrating another scalp. A £6.3m signing from Tottenham, where he struggled for consistency, Capoue has settled into an impressive partnership alongside Ben Watson. It looks as if they have played together for seasons rather than months. The manager, Quique Sánchez Flores, says when asked about how quickly all of his new signings have settled: “I trust a lot in the players, how they want to improve, how is the spirit of this team, how is the soul of these players, I think it’s very important.” Capoue has not just brought soul but flair too. He said recently he feels “free” since leaving Spurs, a feeling that is spread around a carefree squad. Alan Smith•Report: Watford 1-2 Manchester City•Pellegrini aware Agüero holds key to title chances   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest  Manuel Pellegrini hails Manchester City win over Watford – video4) Klopp must address Liverpool’s sluggish startsLiverpool’s performance in their 2-0 defeat by West Ham raised more questions than answers about the Merseysiders’ credentials as a genuine top-four challenger, and one which seems to be particularly troubling Jürgen Klopp is his team’s vulnerability early in games. Michail Antonio’s close-range header made it four times Liverpool have gone behind in the opening 10 minutes of a match since Klopp took charge at Anfield, and the second time in their last four fixtures, following Nathan Aké’s rather comical goal for Watford before Christmas. Klopp’s philosophy centres on a high-intensity, aggressive approach from his players, so it is strange they are sleepwalking into certain games. “It’s something we have spoken about three times [before] and it’s not good,” said the Liverpool manager. Among the other issues he must address is Christian Benteke’s ineffectiveness. The striker has scored six times since arriving from Aston Villa in the summer but regularly looks ill-suited and uninterested when positioned at the top of Liverpool’s attack, as was the case again at Upton Park. Sachin Nakrani•Match report: West Ham 2-0 Liverpool•Klopp claims Liverpool did not give 100% against West Ham•Lanzini could face a month out with thigh injury   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest  Klopp: Liverpool did not give 100% in loss to West Ham – video5) Has Hazard scored his last Chelsea goal?MidfielderEden HazardAppearances19Free Kicks8Corners2Crosses22Assists2Eden Hazard’s early departure at Selhurst Park with a groin injury is an interesting turn for students of the Hazard goal drought, which has now extended to 22 Premier League games. With Chelsea producing their most fluent display of the season, Hazard missed his best chance in some time to end that run. At the same time, as Chelsea goal drought connoisseurs will have noted, a period of absence will impact on his ability to haul in Cesc Fàbregas, whose own non-scoring run is now up to 25 league games. In fact, look a little more closely and this was the outstanding goal drought fixture of the weekend. If Chelsea’s meekness near goal has been a feature of their season, Crystal Palace have overachieved while scoring even fewer. Frazier Campbell, their No9 here, managed nine successful passes in 64 minutes: his last league goal was in February last year. Connor Wickham, injured here, last scored from open play in April. Marouane Chamakh, who came on for Campbell, has one league goal since August 2014. It is a wider theme too. The average goals per game this season (2.6) is just a notch down on recent years, but attacking players with long non-scoring streaks are a feature of even the more ambitious teams (Adam Lallana has one goal in 30 league games; Jesús Navas has one in 81 in all competitions). It is perhaps a sign of changing times. Attacking midfielders, even centre forwards, can spend most of their time fulfilling a high energy tactical role. There are no real pushovers or easy beats. Hazard, last season’s footballer of the year, remains the league’s outstanding drought-merchant. Given that he’s 8-1 to be at Real Madrid by the end of this month he might even – who knows – never score for them again. Barney Ronay•Chelsea swagger past Crystal Palace with Willian gem•Blues play for their future but purge beckons•Hiddink praises players as ‘dirty work’ pays off      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Eden Hazard left the pitch early with an injury as his team-mates enjoyed a return to form at Selhurst Park. Photograph: Craig Mercer/ActionPlus/Corbis6) Newcastle have striking shortages up frontStrikerPapiss CisseAppearances13Goals2Shots15Shots on target40%Offsides12It would not be January without a few hopeful questions to managers about their winter shopping lists. Arsène Wenger and Steve McClaren produced the same coy expression and vague noises about scouring the market for what they need to help their cause over the second half of the season. Newcastle’s need for a striker is plain. Their inability to score in their last three matches has undermined good performances and the news that Papiss Cissé might be absent until spring makes that search even more critical. McClaren’s “two or three months” assessment of Cissé’s injury puts a big burden on the 21-year-old Aleksandar Mitrovic. Only Aston Villa and Swansea have scored fewer Premier League goals than Newcastle and it does their scoring conundrum no favours to recall that six of their 19 came in one splurge against Norwich. The “tireless work” McClaren talks about behind the scenes needs to turn into a signed, sealed and delivered striker to help the cause. Amy Lawrence•Match report: Arsenal 1-0 Newcastle•Daniel Taylor: time for TV companies to be more considerate   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest  Arsenal’s win with heavy legs against Newcastle leaves Wenger relieved – video7) Leicester face a tough run to keep in touchThe vagaries of the fixture list mean that after a tricky December Leicester face another run of challenging matches, specifically a six-game spell that could tell us much about whether Claudio Ranieri’s side can stay the course and gatecrash the top four. A trip to Aston Villa is about as comfortable as it gets these days but the other five league games in the next half a dozen have Leicester going to Tottenham Hotspur, Manchester City and Arsenal. They also host Liverpool and Stoke. Many expect Leicester to fade away and some will seize on a three-game streak in which they have failed to win or score as the start of their fairytale season unravelling. But a goalless draw at home against Manchester City is no disgrace and Leicester would have been celebrating three points on Saturday if Riyad Mahrez had converted from the spot. And, let’s be honest, we all want to see Leicester hang in there, don’t we? Stuart James•Match report: Leicester 0-0 Bournemouth•Stuart James: Ranieri’s safety-first approach means Leicester have nothing to lose•Transfer window wishlists: who Premier League fans want to sign this winter8) Odjidja-Ofoe presses his case at NorwichSouthampton certainly helped their opponents on Saturday – with Sadio Mané’s slovenly timekeeping, several players’ wild finishing and Victor Wanyama’s even wilder tackling – but it should not be overlooked that Norwich also helped themselves. In particular Alex Neil made another influential change from the bench. The Norwich City manager was the first to make a substitution and his introduction of Vadis Odjidja-Ofoe made a real difference. The Belgium international is powerfully built but he is no mere enforcer. Rather he plays with finesse and incision. Shortly after being chopped down by Victor Wanyama in the challenge that led to the Kenyan’s second yellow card, Odjidja-Ofoe set up the winning goal with a tricky run and neat pass to Alex Tettey. After spending an early part of the season on loan at Rotherham United and then growing frustrated at his lack of action at Norwich, Odjidja-Ofoe met the manager last month to discuss his future. Neil promised to give him opportunities to impress before any decision was taken about what to do in January and the player duly impressed in the defeat at Tottenham Hotspur and the victory over Southampton. “Vadis will definitely remain here,” said Neil on Saturday. “He’s shown me and the team that he’s got something to offer us, so credit to him.” Paul Doyle•Match report: Norwich 1-0 Southampton•Neil hopes recent rise will lure players to Norwich      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Vadis Odjidja-Ofoe has finally got the chance he wanted, and deserved, at Norwich City.

It will place such demands on our squad that I will have to give careful consideration to the line-up I select at Arsenal.” When you are second bottom of the table, Cup glory seems an unwanted irrelevance and many Sunderland fans will sigh with understandable relief if, as widely expected, they bow out to the holders at the Emirates on Saturday. Unfortunately managers of much better-placed teams facing somewhat kinder ties may also be distracted by the midweek fixtures with their inconsiderate time-tabling surely a case of the Premier League devaluing the FA Cup.

Leading the mud fight in blue and white was Darren Fletcher, chasing and harrying and being a general nuisance. At 31 he is around a typical box-to-box midfielder’s peak and his ability to cover ground – only five Premier League players have covered more than the West Brom captain this season – is proving essential to Tony Pulis. Claudio Yacob guards the front gate as Fletcher goes foraging and that energy, coupled with an intelligence to read the game, enables him to make small but critical impacts in play; Fletcher recovered possession on five occasions against Stoke, one of which stopped a dangerous counterattack in full flow and launched the move for Stéphane Sessègnon’s well-taken goal. Pulis made a bold move when he installed Fletcher as captain on his arrival last February, risking a rift with the previous incumbent, Chris Brunt, as well as a split in the dressing room. But that gamble has been vital in shaping another immovable Pulis force in the mid-reaches of the Premier League.

~CONTENTS~
Rejoice, fans of tabloid tittle-tattle and internet gossip – the January transfer window is hanging wide open and there is a huge bag of Monday morning moves to get through.Roll up, roll up! It’s the big QPR January sale. Newcastle want to solve their striker shortage with the signing of Charlie Austin, while Sam Allardyce fancies taking Sandro and Steven Caulker up to Sunderland – and Rangers are willing to sell. Allardyce is also close to bagging Lorient’s Lamine Koné.Marko Grujic set for medical on Monday ahead of £5m move to Liverpool Read moreBranislav Ivanovic hasn’t enjoyed a particularly stellar season with Chelsea … so it’s time for a move to Serie A. He’s out of contract in the summer but neither Milan nor Internazionale want to wait until then. Elsewhere in Italy, Juventus are keeping an eye on Fulham’s forward Moussa Dembélé – they face competition from Everton, Manchester United, Paris St Germain and Napoli. And Kolo Touré is heading to Lazio but not until the summer.Mohamed Elneny has coughed into the stethoscopes of Arsenal’s doctors and they’re happy, so the Basel midfielder will complete a £7.3m move to the Emirates this week.Real Madrid are braced for a Manchester City bid for Isco. The Spanish giants won’t sell for any less than £30m but City can probably find that down the back of the sofa.Chelsea want a striker – and the man at the top of their shopping list is Lokomotiv Moscow’s frontman Oumar Niasse, who has eight goals in 15 appearances this season.Sadio Mané is going nowhere this month, but he’ll be wandering through the Southampton exit door in the summer. Manchester United, Bayern Munich and Chelsea are all interested, though the asking price of £40m seems a bit steep.Málaga’s goalkeeper Carlos Kameni is available – Watford and Bournemouth want the Cameroon international to provide competition between the sticks and are happy to fork out the £1m release clause.Norwich still want Internazionale’s central defender Andrea Ranocchia.Crystal Palace are closing in on Senegal’s midfielder Cheikh N’Doye of Angiers, though they’ll have to fight off West Brom, Stoke and Southampton.Out-of-favour Andros Townsend is off to either Newcastle, Sunderland, Aston Villa or Southampton this month.And in Championship news, Hull are struggling to fight off Bournemouth’s interest in Curtis Davies, Middlesbrough want Fulham’s Ross McCormack and Cardiff’s Kenwyne Jones is wanted by Shanghai.

Leicester’s Jamie Vardy to miss one match as he undergoes groin surgery
~CONTENTS~
Jamie Vardy is set to undergo minor groin surgery but the Leicester City striker is expected to miss just one match rather than endure a two-week lay-off that had previously been feared.Claudio Ranieri’s safety-first principle means Leicester have nothing to lose | Stuart James Read moreThe 28-year-old, the joint-leading scorer in the Premier League, requires surgery to repair a long-standing problem. He is only expected to miss Sunday’s FA Cup clash at Tottenham, a game he was likely to have been rested for anyway with the Leicester manager, Claudio Ranieri, set to make several changes to his starting line-up for the third-round tie.The 15-goal striker should be fit again when Leicester return to White Hart Lane in the Premier League three days later before facing Aston Villa on 16 January.Vardy has not scored in his last four matches, while Leicester have not found the net in their last three but despite a defeat and back-to-back draws, Ranieri’s side remain second in the table.

Jürgen Klopp may enter transfer market as Liverpool injuries mount at Stoke
~~AUTHOR~~
Jamie Jackson
~CONTENTS~
Jürgen Klopp was delighted with Liverpool’s 1-0 Capital One Cup semi-final first leg victory over Stoke City at the Britannia Stadium but said he may have to enter the transfer market to alleviate an injury crisis that has now affected 11 players, following hamstring pulls suffered by Philippe Coutinho and Dejan Lovren.“It’s a big shadow over the game for us, the injuries,” said Klopp. “I don’t know how serious and we have to wait for this. Two injuries that’s not good.”Jordon Ibe, who replaced Coutinho after 18 minutes, scored the winner as half-time neared yet by the close Liverpool’s manager was counting the cost of the victory, as Klopp’s team ended the game with Lucas Leiva and Kolo Touré in central defence.The Ivorian also appeared to suffer a hamstring problem, though Klopp stated Touré had informed him this was only cramp.Liverpool travel to Exeter for Friday night’s FA Cup third round tie and Klopp is unsure who he can field in central defence. While Touré may yet be available Mamadou Sakho, who has a knee injury, will not. Joe Gomez is another defender who is unavailable, due to a torn anterior cruciate ligament, and Klopp stated this may force him to add to his squad.“In this moment with no centre-backs fit I would say in this situation maybe we should think about that,” the German said. “Two weeks ago we had three centre-backs – that’s a good situation. When Liverpool started the season they had five with Joe Gomez and now nil in this moment. We could say: ‘White flag, sorry, no [strong] team for Stoke next week, we play somebody else against Stoke and somebody else against Exeter.’ That’s not possible. So we tried everything, the boys did well, now we have the situation where we have to [go on].”Six of Klopp’s injured players have hamstring problems. In addition to Coutinho and Lovren, Daniel Sturridge, Martin Skrtel, Divock Origi, and Jordan Rossiter are all nursing maladies in the muscle.The manager appeared to bridle when asked if he would have to look at his training regime. “We don’t train, we only recover so that’s the situation now,” he said. “When should we train? There’s no training. But no problem, really. I am responsible for these things, and if you want to make me responsible for our hamstrings – that’s the next step, I know this. I know this.”Of the performance Klopp added: “The only thing we can criticise is our finishing again. We had a good structure, played football good, everything was good but we don’t make enough goals.”Mark Hughes insisted the tie was far from over, with the second leg at Anfield to come on 26 January. “As it is it’s just one goal and we’re very much in this tie,” the Stoke manager said.

Stoke’s trident runs out of magic tricks as expectation turns into frustration
~~AUTHOR~~
Stuart James
~CONTENTS~
Nothing is quite as it used to be at the Britannia Stadium. These days Stoke City attract players from Barcelona, the Midlands club have even started to play like the Spanish giants in some people’s eyes – “Stokealona” is the moniker that Bojan Krkic, Xherdan Shaqiri and Marko Arnautovic have brought to the Potteries – and the weather is no longer cold, wet and windy and a key part of their armoury.Mark Hughes, who is the man responsible for leading the revolution (climate change apart), has exceeded all expectations at Stoke, which is a club that sees itself as finishing between eighth and 14th in the Premier League and having a tilt at a cup every few years. The problem, however, with building up such a sense of excitement among supporters and rekindling memories of the team that brought Stoke their only major trophy, back in 1972, is that the comedown is so much harder to stomach when things fail to come off.This ended up being one of those desperately frustrating evenings for Stoke, who flattered to deceive against a Liverpool side that played as if hell-bent on flushing that spineless defeat at West Ham on Saturday out of their system. Stoke, quite simply, never really got going and it was hard to reconcile their prosaic, flat display with the exhilarating performances that the home supporters have been treated to in the last month or so, when Manchester City and Manchester United have been humbled.Jordon Ibe gives Liverpool advantage against Stoke in Capital One Cup Read moreSo much of the pre-match talk had focused on that exciting Bojan, Shaqiri, Arnautovic trident, which has illuminated the Premier League in recent weeks with their box of tricks, yet this was not a night that will live long in the memory for any of them. Bojan was withdrawn after 72 minutes, Shaqiri was peripheral and the reaction when Arnautovic was announced as the man of the match over the public address in the closing minutes was one of bemusement.Even then there was still time for Jonathan Walters, who was introduced at half-time as Hughes turned to the old guard to inject fresh life into his struggling team, to break through in the inside-left channel, but the low poorly hit shot that slid well beyond Simon Mignolet’s far upright was rather symptomatic of Stoke’s night.Scowling as he prowled the touchline, Hughes looked like a man struggling to make sense of what he was seeing at times. The Welshman has been such a breath of fresh air at the club, restoring his own reputation as a manager after the debacle at Queens Park Rangers and transforming Stoke’s at the same time. Peter Coates, the club’s 78-year-old chairman, went as far as to say on the eve of the game this was the best Stoke side he has ever seen, eclipsing the team that won the League Cup 44 years ago, yet this was not the occasion to put that theory to the test.Hughes expressed his frustration with the referee for his timekeeping afterwards but, deep down, the manager will know Stoke’s problems were more of their own doing. They were uncharacteristically careless in possession and even the well-rehearsed training ground set-piece routines failed to come off. Krkic, picked out by Shaqiri’s clever corner kick, horribly miskicked from 12 yards during a first half when Stoke seemed taken aback by the intensity with which Liverpool started the game.Twice in that period Ryan Shawcross came to their rescue, making last-ditch challenges to rob first Philippe Coutinho and then Roberto Firmino. Jack Butland had already denied Adam Lallana by that point with a one-handed save and there was a sense of inevitability that Liverpool would eventually break through. Jordon Ibe, an early replacement for the hamstrung Coutinho, duly delivered after Liverpool raided Stoke’s left flank, where Erik Pieters was left badly exposed.Stoke improved in the second half but there was still an overwhelming sense of anti-climax come the end. Hughes had talked beforehand about there being “a possibility we could take this tie away from Liverpool in the first instance”, which seemed perfectly plausible at the time, yet the Stoke manager finished the game relieved that the tie was still alive. Liverpool, on another day, could have put the game out of sight.Whether that realisation comes back to bite Jürgen Klopp’s players in the second leg at Anfield remains to be seen. What can be said with certainty is that Stoke are capable of playing so much better and, as they demonstrated in their 4-3 win at Goodison Park a couple of weeks ago, wreaking havoc away from home. Perhaps the stage is still set for Krkic, Shaqiri and Arnautovic to prove Coates right and for Hughes to rekindle his own hopes of winning a first trophy as a manager.

Prince Ali says it would be catastrophic if he does not become Fifa president
~~AUTHOR~~
Owen Gibson
~CONTENTS~
Prince Ali bin al-Hussein, the Jordanian Fifa presidential candidate, has claimed it would be “catastrophic” for football if he does not win the race to succeed Sepp Blatter in February.The former Fifa executive committee member, who will meet with the FA chairman Greg Dyke and the other home nations while in London, said the organisation was on the brink of extinction if it failed to properly reform.“Everyone recognises this is the last chance to get it right,” he said. “We don’t want a situation where two years down the line, more scandals come out. I’m determined that we do save Fifa and do it from within.”Prince Ali, who was defeated by Blatter in May’s presidential election shortly before the Swiss agreed to step down in the midst of a spiralling corruption crisis, said that he was the only candidate who had the will to properly reform the organisation.Fifa in crisis amid corruption arrests and World Cup voting inquiry – as it happened Read more“If it’s not done this time and we continue to have problems in the future, I think it will be a real catastrophe for the organisation,” he said. “I have been stable in terms of what I see as the future of Fifa, I am not someone who changes his mind dependent on the situation.”Prince Ali refused to directly comment on his rivals – the Uefa general secretary Gianni Infantino, the Asian Football Confederation president Sheikh Salman, the South African Tokyo Sexwale and the former Fifa executive Jérôme Champagne – but implied they would deliver more of the same.Of the eight-year bans handed down last month to Blatter and the Uefa president Michel Platini by the Fifa ethics committee, he said: “Everything has to be on the books. In this day and age, to have an oral agreement is totally irresponsible.”Publishing an updated manifesto, Prince Ali promised to limit the Fifa president and executive committee members to two four-year terms and publish the salaries of all senior officials. He also suggested he would overhaul the bidding rules for the World Cup to mirror the International Olympic Committee system introduced in the wake of the Salt Lake City bribery scandal.“You base the decision on where to host the World Cup on what the evaluation team recommends,” he said. “That is where it has to go. I don’t think it’s correct for executive committee members to be travelling to host nations.”Ali called again for the immediate release of Michael Garcia’s full report into the 2018 and 2022 World Cup bidding process, which was released as a highly unsatisfactory summary that was disowned by its author.The former Fifa vice-president’s chances have been limited by the fact he is not backed by any particular confederation but believes that the 209 member associations have more leeway to make their own minds up than had previously been the case.Ali said that he would be a “hands-on president” who would “take responsibility”.In contrast Sheikh Salman, the Bahraini Asian Football Confederation president who remains the favourite to win February’s election, said last month that he would reform the embattled organisation by making the presidential role more akin to that of a non-executive chairman.“I shall be a non-executive president who supervises a new top class management team but leads by example and not by micro-managing every aspect of the organisation,” he said, unveiling his reform proposals that included separating the organisation into a “football Fifa” and a “business Fifa”.Prince Ali said the existing reform proposals presented by Fifa remained “very vague” but conceded he would have to unpick them at the next Fifa Congress in May if he was successful in winning the presidency.

Gareth Barry keen for the good side of Goodison to drive Everton to Wembley
~~AUTHOR~~
Andy Hunter
~CONTENTS~
Only two players have more Premier League experience than Gareth Barry and, in his qualified opinion, there is no tougher venue to visit than a floodlit Goodison Park. The 34-year-old needs Manchester City to discover what he means on Wednesdayas the old place is proving more problematic to Everton this season than most of its guests. “There are definitely two sides to Goodison and we have got to use it to our advantage,” the veteran insists.It can be a mark of the underdog to talk up a crowd’s influence before an important cup tie, as Barry and Roberto Martínez have done before the Capital One Cup semi-final first leg, but there are more significant reasons for the current focus on the mood at Goodison.Gerard Deulofeu excels as Everton ease past Middlesbrough in Capital One Cup Read moreWednesday’s semi-final represents a test of Everton’s emerging talents and supporters’ faith in the long-term approach Martínez espouses as the club’s best way of delivering silverware and top-four finishes. There have been signs of erosion recently with Everton’s lauded attacking style yielding just one win in six matches and three wins from 11 Premier League home games all season. City were among the eight to depart with points after a 2-0 win in August and Martínez’s team, keen to maintain the initiative on home soil even at the expense of closing out games, have conceded 20 league goals at Goodison this term compared with nine away.Tim Howard has reacted to sarcastic cheers from the Gwladys Street after collecting routine crosses in the last two games. John Stones urged the Park End to get off his back having performed three Cruyff turns in his penalty area during the final stages of Sunday’s draw against Tottenham Hotspur – successfully, it should be said – when groans followed Everton throughout the contest. The longing for a first trophy since 1995, in a competition Everton have never won, heightens the anxiety surrounding City’s visit.Barry admits: “You will feel that tension in the air. This club is waiting to make the step to Wembley. The players are aware of that. I am. It is down to us to get on the pitch and achieve the performance that will set us up to get through. We never seem to make things easy for ourselves at Everton and at City it was the same, having to come from behind to get ahead in the big games. But we have to be confident that we can beat them.“For me, Goodison is the toughest away ground to come to. I have experienced it. At the minute we are not using that to our advantage for some reason. That is what we need to set up on Wednesday. If you are an opposition player and you want to take a touch but the crowd is on your back, it is a difficult place to play. Under the lights here, the atmosphere is that much stronger. We need to use that to our advantage.”The midfielder, a Premier League and FA Cup winner during his four seasons at City, cites a 1-0 defeat against David Moyes’s Everton in January 2012 as evidence of Goodison’s ability to intimidate both sides. Barry recalls: “The one when Gibbo [Darron Gibson] scored stands out because I saw both sides of Goodison that night. We were on top in the first half and I remember the home crowd getting on the Everton players’ backs. I thought to myself: ‘We’ve got them here because they are feeling the pressure.’ Then, all of a sudden, a couple of challenges turned it around. We started feeling it then. There are definitely two sides to Goodison and we have got to use it to our advantage. Any crowd that gets on your back makes it difficult but you are going to get that if things aren’t going well. The fans have got their right to give their opinion.”Opinion on Barry has been universally positive at Everton this season. Without the demands of European football, which took a toll last season, the midfielder’s control and composure continue to impress and prompted Martínez to proclaim recently that the former England international could continue until the age of 40. Ryan Giggs and Frank Lampard are the two players to have made more Premier League appearances than Barry, who is now 27 games behind Lampard’s 609.“I feel good for my age,” he admits. “There are not too many players my age playing regularly in the Premier League. It’s a good feeling and it’s great to hear from the manager because that gives you confidence. I just take it a season at a time because I know in football things can change so quickly.”Barry has 18 months remaining on his Everton contract and one clear ambition. His old club present a formidable obstacle to achieving it. “I’ve played against Manchester City three times since I left and have lost them all!” he reflects, ominously from a royal blue perspective.“People have been on their backs, saying they wait until they need to turn it on, but the quality is obviously there. When it comes to the business end they will produce and, for me, they are the favourites to win the league.“It’s just another game, though. Manchester City are just another team that needs to be beaten and standing in our way of achieving the ambition of lifting a trophy for Everton. The last two years of my career at Everton, I want to win a trophy. I managed to do it at City, being part of a group that ended a long wait for a trophy, and to do it here would be fantastic.”

Manuel Pellegrini: I’d rather win title and be sacked than fail and stay
~~AUTHOR~~
Jamie Jackson
~CONTENTS~
Manuel Pellegrini has said he would rather win the title and be sacked by Manchester City than continue as manager without enjoying that level of success.Pellegrini takes his side to Everton for Wednesday’s Capital One Cup semi-final first leg hoping to guide City to a second triumph in the competition in three years. He won the Premier League in his first season in charge and City sit third in the table on 39 points, three behind the leaders, Arsenal. The manager stated the title is the priority and he would take it at the cost of his job.Pep Guardiola has confirmed he wants to coach in the Premier League next season and there continues to be confidence at City that the Spaniard will become the club’s manager.Sergio Agüero will not be rested for Manchester City’s tie against Everton Read moreAlthough not discussing this precise scenario Pellegrini, whose contract expires at the end of the 2016-17 season, stated that if he were to win the championship and then be removed that would be acceptable. “I don’t think my position in the future is linked to titles,” he said. “For me, as a manager, it’s important to win the title because it’s my job. You ask me personally, my way of thinking is that if I have the option to renew here for five years more or to win the title and be sacked, I’d prefer to win the title. For a manager, your work is to win the title, so the other doesn’t matter.”Pellegrini denied it would be harder for City or any club to sack a manager who has won a trophy that season. “I don’t think so. I think that if you are the owner of a club, you must have the option to replace the manager if they win the title or if they don’t win the title,” he said. “It just is about your trust in the way you work. That is more important than if you win a title or not for the owners. That’s why we are just talking about Real Madrid always changing if you don’t win a title. I don’t think that’s the best way. On the other side, you can win a title, and of course the owner can not be happy with your work and they have the right to change. But as managers, the most important thing is to win.”Despite the continuing uncertainty regarding his long-term future Pellegrini stated City are different to Real. Rafael Benítez was sacked after half a season on Monday, while Pellegrini was removed from Real following the 2009-10 season in which they finished second, with 96 points.“A lot of things are different. That is why one team is changing its manager every year and at this club it is not the policy of the owners to change immediately when you don’t win a title. I repeat, different projects for each club,” Pellegrini said.“At least I finished the year [at Real]. I knew from the beginning I was not to continue for the next year. There were some important differences with the president but it is not strange when you see what happened in Real Madrid in the last five or six years. I am sorry about Rafa Benítez because I think he is a manager who deserves respect but it is not strange what happened at Real Madrid.”Pellegrini believes Yaya Touré may no longer be able to play every game for City. The midfielder scored an impressive late equaliser in Saturday’s 2-1 victory at Watford and is expected to start at Everton but the manager accepts that, at the age of 32, Touré may have to be rested on occasion.“I think every player must always want to play every game,” Pellegrini said. “That’s a good mentality. Yaya always tries to play. Maybe for the amount of games we must play, it’s not good for him to play every game. But I’m very happy with the mentality of those players that they are always ready to play.“He’s not only scoring important goals – he’s scored important goals in the last few games – but I think Yaya gives very good play to our team. He’s the midfielder from where the balls have the most amount of passes to make the last decisive pass, so I think he’s a very important player. A lot of media criticise his body language and the way he runs but if you had all the statistics of Yaya after every game, he’s the one player who runs more.”

Roberto Martínez says Capital One Cup will not make Everton’s stars stay
~~AUTHOR~~
Andy Hunter
~CONTENTS~
Roberto Martínez has said Champions League qualification – not winning the Capital One Cup – is the only way Everton can convince their best young players to remain at Goodison Park.Everton host Manchester City in the first leg of the Capital One Cup semi-final on Wednesday striving to win a first trophy since the 1995 FA Cup.Martínez insists ending the club’s 21-year wait for silverware is an ambition for this season but, in another demonstration of how the Champions League has superseded domestic cup competitions, believes players will not measure progress by a Wembley triumph alone.Everton have failed to capitalise on an open Premier League season by challenging for a top-four place, winning only one of their past seven league matches. Everton’s last win at Goodison came on 21 November against bottom of the table Aston Villa. But, with interest expected to develop in Romelu Lukaku, John Stones and Ross Barkley in the summer, the Everton manager admits Champions League football offers the most persuasive argument for staying at Goodison.“I don’t think winning a cup will keep the young players, I think qualifying for the Champions League could help to keep young players,” said Martínez, who will continue his cup policy of selecting Joel Robles instead of Tim Howard against Manuel Pellegrini’s side.“The reality is that we have taken a very different approach to what we are as a team than we took at this club three years ago. Three years ago it was a very experienced team who knew how to win games but had some sort of ceiling. Now we have gone very young with immense potential to go beyond that ceiling, and there has been investment in that potential so we will get the rewards from it.“I wouldn’t say I don’t want to win silverware, because that is what this club is about and our aim is to have that drive and ambition to do that, but the aim is to get into the top four and that is what we have set out to achieve. How long that is going to take I don’t know, but I don’t think winning a cup will help us to keep players. What will make it easier in the modern game is to fight for the top four positions in the league.”Martínez denied he is resigned to losing key talent and cites Everton’s refusal to sell John Stones to Chelsea last summer, despite receiving bids in excess of £30m plus a transfer request from the England international, as evidence of a club developing on its terms.“Actions speak louder than words,” he said. “We had a player that any other club would have sold last summer but we didn’t. We could not have been more clear and resolute in our project. There are right moments and wrong moments to lose a player. I’m saying to every single Evertonian to trust we will make the right decision on football terms, it is not going to be on financial terms. It is not going to be about balancing the books. That would be very wrong, dangerous or negative.“But, in the same way in the modern game, young players need to be in the position that they want to stay in the club. It is the only way you can have a winning team if the players want to perform. To keep them wanting to play for our football club is to achieve and to grow and to play in the best competitions. That doesn’t mean we are going to sell them if we don’t get in the Champions League, but you wouldn’t want to keep a player that doesn’t want to represent our shirt either. You have to be realistic. The decisions will be for the good of Everton. Last summer nobody could leave and the fans know how resolute we were on that.”As for the January transfer window, Everton are expected to complete the £3m signing of Shani Tarashaj, the Switzerland under-21 international forward, from Grasshopper Zurich on Wednesday. The 20-year-old will spend the remainder of the season on loan at Grasshopper before returning to Merseyside in the summer.Martínez wants to keep Kevin Mirallas despite interest from Monaco and the Belgium international’s relative inactivity this season but Steven Naismith, Aiden McGeady and Darron Gibson could all leave this month.Naismith is considering an £8.5m move to Norwich City while Championship clubs have inquired about taking McGeady and Gibson, both Republic of Ireland internationals, on loan. Celtic are also interested in a reunion with McGeady who, like Gibson, needs regular football before the European Championship but the winger’s wages are prohibitive. Everton want any loan deal to cover the players’ wages in full.

Jordon Ibe gives Liverpool advantage against Stoke in Capital One Cup
~~AUTHOR~~
Daniel Taylor
~CONTENTS~
Perhaps the greatest compliment that can be paid to the way Liverpool set about this tie is that in the closing stages Stoke City had abandoned all the deft soft-touch football for which they would like to be renowned and gone back to aiming long, hopeful balls up to Peter Crouch. There was no way through and Jürgen Klopp’s team deserve their lead after subduing a side that has already beaten Manchester United, Chelsea and Manchester City on this ground this season.Stoke certainly chose a bad night to forget the qualities that have made them such dangerous opponents recently and, having been reminded so many times that this was their first semi-final in this competition since 1972, it has to be questioned whether they allowed a little uncertainty to creep in. Bojan Krkic and Xherdan Shaqiri were substituted after strangely listless performances and there was a collective gasp from the crowd when the public announcer named Marko Arnautovic as the man of the match.Krkic connected only with thin air with his one chance to score. Shaqiri’s night was summed up when he hit a corner straight out of play and Arnautovic rarely threatened a Liverpool side who outpassed the home team for long spells, particularly in the first half when the substitute Jordon Ibe scored the game’s decisive goal. Klopp’s men are now in a considerable position of strength before the second leg at Anfield on 26 January and the only downside is the sudden epidemic of hamstring injuries that has left them with a patched-up back four, Philippe Coutinho back on the treatment table and the makings of a defensive crisis.Stoke City 0-1 Liverpool: five talking points from Britannia Stadium | Jamie Jackson Read moreTheir victory certainly came at a cost given that Coutinho lasted only 17 minutes and was limping so heavily when Ibe replaced him that the Brazilian cannot be expected back for Liverpool’s next two Premier League fixtures, at home to Arsenal and Manchester United. Dejan Lovren was next after a challenge on Shaqiri, meaning Liverpool had to experiment with Lucas Leiva, a central midfielder, in the heart of their defence and Kolo Touré will also need to undergo a scan after feeling a sharp pain in the back of his leg in the last 10 minutes.Touré chose to play on, telling Liverpool’s medical staff it was merely cramp, but Klopp talked afterwards about having “zero centre-halves left”, indicating he feared it might be something more serious. If so, Liverpool have now had 25 different injuries since Klopp joined the club and are missing 11 players. In the circumstances, they showed commendable resolve not to allow all the changes and disruption to break their supremacy. “We could have waved a white flag,” Klopp said, “but that’s not possible.”His team began the game with great self-belief, knocking the ball around confidently and repeatedly opening up their opponents. There were only fleeting moments when the Leiva-Touré partnership was seriously threatened and it was strange to see Stoke operating with so little fluency of their own. Mark Hughes looked agitated in his technical area from the opening few minutes and the moment Glen Johnson subjected Coutinho to a perfectly-executed nutmeg was incongruous given how the first half panned out. Stoke looked sluggish in a way that could never have been expected and, for a team that pride themselves on their structure and organisation, it was unusual to see how often they lost the ball inside their own half.Two minutes after Ibe’s goal, Roberto Firmino ran clear after dispossessing Glenn Whelan only to be let down by a piece of poor control. Liverpool, eight-time winners of this competition, could also reflect on several other chances and their inability to take them was really the only form of encouragement for Stoke. “People seem to want to criticise our performance in the first half, but sometimes you have to give credit to the opponents,” Hughes said.“The important thing for us is that we are still in the tie and we will look to impose our tactics on them in the second leg as they have with us.”The goal arrived in the 37th minute when James Milner, replacing Lovren after his own injury layoff, picked out Adam Lallana on the right. Lallana turned a low centre into the penalty area and, though Joe Allen’s shot was miscued, the ball spun conveniently for Ibe. His first touch managed to get the ball under control and the second picked out the corner with a left-foot shot.Hughes brought on Jonathan Walters at half-time to add some extra height to Stoke’s attack, taking off the midfielder Geoff Cameron and moving Krkic into a more withdrawn role. The idea was to capitalise on Lucas’s lack of inches and it was the same later on when Crouch was introduced and Stoke effectively returned to their tactics of old.For the first time, there were moments to indicate Liverpool might be vulnerable. Even then, however, there was the sight of Krkic aiming a simple pass out of play.Hughes was exaggerating to say that Stoke had dominated the second half and his complaints about Liverpool’s time-wasting did not entirely stack up either. Simon Mignolet was booked for taking too long with one goal-kick but Liverpool’s win had its origins in the way they moved the ball during the opening 45 minutes. They outdid Stoke at their own game and, from here, it will need something special for Hughes’s team to advance.Stoke City v Liverpool: Capital One Cup, semi-final first leg – as it happened Read more

Stoke City 0-1 Liverpool: five talking points from Britannia Stadium
~~AUTHOR~~
Jamie Jackson
~CONTENTS~
1) Liverpool should be fearful favouritesAn away goal and a victory ahead in the first leg of the semi-final makes the Anfield club the better bet to reach the Capital One Cup final next month. The caveat is Stoke’s grit and the undoubted quality in their ranks that failed to fire on this occasion. This may not be the case in two weeks’ time on Merseyside.Beforehand Stoke’s captain, Ryan Shawcross, said: “We have shown over the past year to 18 months that we can match and hurt any side in the division, irrespective of their standing in the game. That is why we are taking a huge amount of confidence into the two forthcoming matches that separates us from a spot at Wembley for what would be a third time in five years.” Mark Hughes’s side were disappointing yet only lost by a single goal. This should give them hope that Jürgen Klopp’s men can be turned over before their own crowd. If they can do that the dream of emulating the 1972 vintage that won this trophy will be 90 minutes away.Jordon Ibe gives Liverpool advantage against Stoke in Capital One Cup Read more2) Klopp’s gang remain short of a gunslingerThe headline number hanging over this Liverpool side as they arrived was their 22 goals in 20 league games. This is the poorest return since the club was founded 124 years ago and while Klopp took charge in early October he has overseen 11 of these matches, in which 15 strikes is the count.When Philippe Coutinho limped off in the first half the lack of confidence Klopp has in his one fit striker was illustrated by him refusing to put on Christian Benteke. Instead, Jordon Ibe entered and it was the youngster who scored first. This vindicated the manager in one sense yet despite dominating for long periods Liverpool never appeared likely to pile up the goals.If Klopp has little faith in Benteke then Daniel Sturridge has to end his injury nightmare soon or the German should start searching for an AN Other who can do the business game-in, game-out at the business end of the park.3) Stoke’s three-pointed star has shone brighterWhen on song Stoke’s three star turns form a kind of Bermuda Triangle that suck in opposition defences via their devilry on and off the ball. Manchester City and Manchester United have been the prime scalps this term and Hughes stated that they could again be the side’s x-factor. To have a former Barcelona player in Krkic and two ex-Internazionale footballers as the Potters’ focal point is a telling sign of the new times at Stoke. Yet Klopp had instructed his players to get as close as possible to them to stymie the threat and an embarrassing mishit shot by Krkic showed how this upset their collective rhythm. A further indicator was the removal of Geoff Cameron for Jonathan Walters at half-time, Hughes deciding to field a more traditional centre-forward rather than the more ephemeral qualities of Krkic. This had the latter dropping back on occasion where his threat to Liverpool was blunted.Stoke City v Liverpool: Capital One Cup, semi-final first leg – as it happened Read more4) Britannia support refuses to be becalmedThe prospect of the Britannia Stadium roar propelling Hughes’s men on under the midweek lights had the manager enthused.“The fans will be huge for us,” he said. “The players feed into the passion of the fans – they sense it and it adds a couple of yards to their sprints and inches to their leaps. It shouldn’t be underestimated what impact our fans can have on a game. If we play well and get on the front foot straight away and they are behind us, which I know they will be, it makes a huge difference.”The problem was that Stoke struggled for fluidity during an opening half in which Liverpool dominated possession and took the lead, so the crowd gradually quietened. Yet after the break the Potters faithful again showed why this is an intimidating arena to visit. They rediscovered their voice – particularly when Glenn Whelan was denied a penalty – and ensured Liverpool could never relax.5) How much of a spectre should a ghost No9 be?Is a false No9 there to score or to drop away from the front to create space for a team-mate to do so? This was the poser that came to mind when Klopp dropped Christian Benteke and asked Roberto Firmino to operate at Liverpool’s head. The 24-year-old’s record since arriving at Anfield suggested he might not leave the ground having registered a hat-trick. Statistics are supposed to have a plastic quality that allows them to be bent to prove any argument. Yet for the £29m paid to Hoffenheim in the summer a single strike from 29 appearances seems a paltry return. The 16 in 33 Bundesliga games two years ago shows Firmino has known where the goal is but this dropped to eight in 34 in all competitions last season. When Jordon Ibe opened proceedings it came from an Adam Lallana cross that was mishit on to Ibe from Joe Allen. Firmino was hardly in the picture but maybe this is the point of his ersatz position.

Zinedine Zidane tops popularity charts at Real Madrid
~~AUTHOR~~
Sid Lowe
~CONTENTS~
There was a moment at the end of Zinedine Zidane’s presentation as the manager of Real Madrid when he was asked what he would settle for between now and the end of the season. Aged 43, he is after all embarking on his first top-flight managerial job, for which his only experience is 18 months with the kids in the Madrid B team, down in Spain’s 80-team, regionalised third tier,and he arrives mid-way through the season, inheriting a team in third place, having been hammered 4-0 in the clásico, and have been whistled by their own fans during every home game for six weeks.“Winning everything,” he replied.Little else will do, Zidane knows. “Wouldn’t it have been better to have arrived at the start of a season?” he was asked. “Yes, but six months have passed and I’m here now.” “Is the Champions League really an objective?” he was asked. “Yes. When you play with this shirt, everything is real: winning is fundamental at this club and the Champions League is the objective and it always will be.” “Are you really ready?” he was asked. “No manager is ever ready, still less someone who has never coached before. But I’m ready. I want this. I have ilusión.”Real Madrid sack Benítez and Zidane takes over – as it happened Read moreAlongside “work”, ilusión was the word he repeated most often: hope, enthusiasm, a dream. It may yet prove just another illusion at a club where many problems are not so much managerial as structural; ilusión may just be the normal first day feeling, briefly experienced by all the rest and quickly lost. There have been 21 coaches in the last 20 years, 11 in a decade under Florentino Pérez alone. Yet none have been quite like Zidane, perhaps not even José Mourinho. There was ilusión , all right.Forgotten already, barely mentioned, it was as if Rafa Benítez had never been there at all. On Monday, no questions had been allowed and no explanation was offered for a sacking that Benítez’s camp claimed had not even been communicated. On Tuesday, the club’s institutional director Emilio Butragueño, facing the media where the president Pérez would not, gestured at Zidane. “The answer is here,” he said, evading an answer. “All I can say is that we’re delighted he’s the new coach and we trust in him. A new chapter has opened, with a lot of ilusión.”Zidane’s lack of experience didn’t matter. Despite the fact his results for the B team have been mixed and the president had his own reservations, many have drawn parallels to Pep Guardiola at Barcelona. “Don’t,” Zidane responded. “Guardiola is Guardiola. Guardiola is a formidable coach. What he is doing is incredible but I am not going to compare us: I never did it as a player and I am never going to do it as a coach. What matters is the day-to-day work, what I can show to the squad.”The status is similar though and after five years spent playing for Madrid, volleyed winner in the European Cup final included, Zidane’s eminence matters. It may be his strongest card. For now, at least.“You are a legend,” one question began. “Will that mean the president treats you better?” “No: not at all, the role of the coach is to get results and what matters is that we win matches,” Zidane said but he knows his position is stronger than that of his predecessor, even if he is even more aware than might be imagined that presidential prerogative will remain: he has experienced that already with Castilla, Madrid’s reserve team, where Martin Odegaard’s protege status has proven occasionally problematic.When it came to the players, Zidane conceded his playing past could help, not least as he knows most of them. He played with the captain, Sergio Ramos, in his final season a decade ago, and he was assistant to Carlo Ancelotti when Madrid won the European Cup in 2014. Carrying out individualised drills, he was close to some of them. He is certainly seen more as one of them than Benítez was. “It’s an important point. I know the dressing room; I was with them with Ancelotti,” he said. “But then it’s the work [that matters],” he said.Some of Madrid’s players had a nickname for Benítez that mocked him for the way he tried to tell them what to do and how to kick a ball despite the fact he had never played professionally: the No10, they called him. Now they have a real No10, even if he did wear No5 when he played here, and Zidane admittedthe “most important thing” was to have a good relationship with the players. They are the ones who must perform; they are also a source of power.“For sure the treatment will be different [to Castilla]: they are experienced players, Real Madrid players,” he said. “But the message I will have for players will be the same: that’s going to be based on work. You have to be close to the players, to have a good relationship with all of them. I am responsible for the team and I want everything to go well so I want a good relationship with everyone.”That includes Gareth Bale, one of the few Madrid players upset at the departure of Benítez. “I understand that he can been annoyed because he was an important coach for him but he is going to have the same affection [from me] as with Rafa,” Zidane said. “He is important for the squad, fundamental for the team. He is phenomenal and what he has been doing recently is fantastic. I’m going to give him all my affection and support so that he plays well.” Affection is one thing; Bale’s position is another. He does not want to be returned to the wing.That remains to be seen. What Bale does know already is that he will play with Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema. Asked about James Rodríguez, Zidane took the opportunity to insist that “all players will be important”, that he would count on the “entire squad”. So far, so standard. When he was asked whether Bale, Benzema and Cristiano – “the BBC” – would remain his forward line, the answer was more unequivocal. “Yes,” he said. “Yes they will play. That is my idea. Clearly.”Those most excited by Zidane’s arrival are the fans, of course, and that is the point at a club partly driven by populism. With Benítez in trouble, one newspaper poll already had over 70% of supporters backing him to come in. In the morning, he took his first training session with the team at the Alfredo Di Stéfano stadium constructed at the club’s Valdebebas HQ. It was Madrid’s annual open session, children invited for free on Spain’s equivalent of Christmas Eve: Reyes, when the three kings are said to have reached Bethlehem bearing gifts. Zidane was theirs.The timing was probably not coincidental. Benítez may have been booed; Zidane was applauded by 5,000, the arena almost full. He waved and they chanted his name. Before that he had gone round the dressing room and shaken the players’ hands one by one. “My first words were simple ones,” he said. “I said I was happy to be at their side and that we were beginning a new adventure and that we would do all we could to reach our objectives.”How, though? While some saw Zidane the player as elegant and effortless, he always preferred to see himself as a competitor. But style does matter. “It has always been important to see nice football and that’s the path I will follow,” he said. “Attacking, balanced football. Playing from the back, getting into the other half of the pitch quickly, keeping possession of the ball. I will try to give our football my personal touch, an attacking touch. I want the players to enjoy it on the pitch.”So, he was asked, who is your role model, the coach who you will try to emulate? He has learnt from the best, after all. He was sporting director when José Mourinho was coach, assistant when Ancelotti was in charge, and he travelled to watch Guardiola work at Bayern while he completed his licence and prepared himself for this moment.“I knew them well and I had a lot of other coaches as a player too,” Zidane said. “And I have taken important things from all of them. Now, what I have to do is to be the coach that I want to be. Everyone says that to me: ‘Do what you think is right for your players and your team.’ You can’t do the same as another coach did. I have to be Zidane.”

Emmanuel Adebayor considering offers from Watford and Crystal Palace

~CONTENTS~
Emmanuel Adebayor is considering the offer of contracts until the end of the season from Watford and Crystal Palace, as he looks to reignite his career in the Premier League.The 31-year-old striker has been without a club since last September, when his deal at Tottenham Hotspur was terminated by mutual agreement, after he endured a dramatic fall from grace. But he has been keeping fit with the help of a personal trainer and he wants a return to action this month.Adebayor is keen to remain in London, where he has a house in Golders Green, and so the proposals of Watford and Palace tick one box for him. Quique Sánchez Flores, the Watford manager, has previously refused to rule out a move for him and it is understood that the basic offer on the table from the club is more lucrative than that from Palace.Troy Deeney and Odion Ighalo have excelled as a partnership over the first half of the season, but the club would like to add quality cover.Palace’s offer is heavily incentivised and it also contains a break clause that would be triggered in the event of Adebayor breaching any of the club’s disciplinary rules.Alan Pardew, the manager, is keen to add a striker before the end of the window, as he is painfully aware that his current crop have contributed only one league goal this season – and that was a penalty, scored by Connor Wickham. Wickham has struggled with injury – he is currently out with a calf problem – and Dwight Gayle is unavailable because of hamstring trouble.“We’ve been happy with Wickham and if we can keep him and Gayle fit, and get Marouane Chamakh up to speed, we will be OK,” Pardew has said. “But we are still looking at the market to see if there is anything with a bit of value.”Palace, who have failed to score in their past three matches, have also spoken to representatives of the Fiorentina striker Khouma Babacar.It remains to be seen how quickly Adebayor would be able to shake off the cobwebs. Fitness is one thing but match fitness quite another, and he has barely played since he lost his place in the Tottenham team in November 2014. He featured only five times after that over the second half of last season, and only once in the starting lineup.Adebayor had a proposed loan to West Ham United blocked last February and, before the closure of the summer window, when he was again a target for West Ham, he insisted that Tottenham paid up his contract in full – a sum of £5m – enabling him to move as a free agent. Tottenham refused.Adebayor had spent the summer training away from Mauricio Pochettino’s first team and, after the window shut, he was excluded from the 25-man Premier League squad the manager submitted. Shortly afterwards, Adebayor reached the settlement on his contract.Palace’s next home fixture is against Tottenham on 23 January.

Earlier medical help might have saved Hillsborough teenager, inquest told
~~AUTHOR~~
David Conn
~CONTENTS~
A teenage boy who was one of the 96 people to die at Hillsborough in 1989 may have been alive when a police officer concluded he was dead and covered his face with a tunic, the new inquest into the disaster has heard on the final day of evidence.An expert witness, Dr Jasmeet Soar, told the inquests that high-quality medical attention might have saved the life of James Aspinall, who was 18 when he went to Sheffield Wednesday’s football ground to support Liverpool in the FA Cup semi-final against Nottingham Forest. Soar agreed with Judy Khan QC, representing the Aspinall family, that James may have suffered a cardiac arrest not when he was trapped in the crush in pen three of Hillsborough’s Leppings Lane Terrace, but later, when he was lying on the pitch having been removed from the pen, or after that, when carried across the pitch. These were “all real possibilities”, Soar said.Robert Fox, the South Yorkshire police officer who encountered James lying on the pitch, has previously told the inquests that he believed he must have checked for a pulse and other signs of life and been certain there were none, before he draped his tunic over James’s face “for dignity”. Footage filmed by the BBC, whose cameras were at Hillsborough to cover the football match, determined that Fox spent one minute and 16 seconds with James before covering his face and moving on to other casualties.“Again, in this case, there is also a possibility that an earlier or more sustained medical effort might have saved James’ life, is that right?” Khan asked.“Yes,” Soar replied. “Earlier intervention before cardiac arrest may have been successful.”Aspinall’s mother, Margaret, the chair of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, who was in court, wept as the evidence about her son was heard.His death was one of six whose medical details were considered on the final day, completing pathology evidence on all 96 people who died following the crush. The 279 days of evidence heard in a converted courtroom on a Warrington business park constitute the longest case heard by a jury in British legal history.The coroner, Sir John Goldring, told the jury of seven women and three men that he would begin summing up the evidence on 25 January. This is expected to take three weeks. The jury will then have a week’s break before beginning to consider their verdict on 22 February, which will take the form of answering specific questions about how the 96 people died.One of the people whose deaths were considered on the final day, Tony Bland, who was also 18, was maintained on life support in hospital for four years before his parents were granted an application for him to be allowed to die. The inquest heard that although Bland’s heart was restarted with cardiopulmonary respiration (CPR) performed by an off-duty doctor, Colin Flenley, working with a South Yorkshire police constable, Steven Plows, the loss of oxygen while Tony had stopped breathing caused severe brain damage.Prof Jerry Nolan, giving expert evidence, said the fact that Bland’s heartbeat was restored on the pitch by 3.26pm suggested he went into cardiac arrest just a few minutes before that, not necessarily when he was first brought out of the pen. Nolan agreed with Nick Brown, representing Bland’s family, that earlier emergency attention could have saved his life.“There is no doubt that earlier treatment in Tony’s case may well have resulted in a different outcome,” Nolan said.Bland was placed in an already crowded ambulance, on top of another casualty laid on the floor, the inquests have heard, and taken to Sheffield’s Northern General hospital. There, a medical expert, Prof David Menon, has previously said, Bland would normally have been intubated to open an airway before he was taken to intensive care, although Menon acknowledged that the hospital and doctors were responding under great pressure. Bland was eventually transferred to Airedale hospital to be nearer the family home in Keighley, where he was kept on life support until he was allowed to die on 3 March 1993.When the law lords granted permission for life support to be switched off, Bland’s neuropathologist reported that “the severity and extent of the brain injury are of a degree to suggest that there could never have been any recovery beyond the vegetative state.”David Rimmer, a 38-year-old married father of two, died after the crush in pen four of the Leppings Lane terrace, the inquests heard. Film was shown of other Liverpool supporters sitting on top of the high metal fence at the front of the terrace trying unsuccessfully to lift him over the fence. Soar said Rimmer was “at least deeply unconscious” at that time, 3.11pm, and was possibly dead before then. His postmortem examination revealed that he had bruises and blue paint on his pelvis, evidence that he had been forced in the pen against a barrier, which was painted blue.Soar assessed that David Mather, then 19, seen in footage of the crowd “alive and well” at 2.59pm, was unconscious when he was placed on the pitch at 3.22pm, before CPR efforts were started a minute later. Soar agreed with Khan that rapid treatment, with no gaps, could have made a difference in those circumstances.“Ideally, when he is initially placed on the pitch, there should have been treatment immediately at that point, yes?” Khan asked. “Ideally, yes,” Soar replied.Two brothers, Nick Hewitt, 16, and Carl Hewitt, 17, from Oadby, Leicestershire, were shown in still footage standing next to each other towards the front of the terrace at about 3.04pm, although Nolan said it was not clear that Nick was still conscious then.Nolan agreed with Christina Lambert QC, for Goldring, that at 3.30pm, when Carl was on the pitch, “appropriate medical intervention could have been capable of saving his life”. Ultimately, however, after five minutes of unsuccessful CPR efforts, including by a trainee doctor, a police constable could not find signs of life. PC Stephen Hurst and others carried Carl up the pitch and into the Hillsborough gymnasium, on a stepladder, which they used as a makeshift stretcher.At the conclusion of the final day’s evidence, Goldring warned the jury not to talk about the case or to “seek anything out” about it on the internet during the days waiting for his summing up to begin on 25 January.

Rafa Benítez thanks Real Madrid fans as he bids farewell to the club
~CONTENTS~
Rafael Benítez has expressed his gratitude for having the opportunity to manage Real Madrid and wished his successor, Zinedine Zidane, well.The former Valencia, Liverpool, Chelsea and Napoli manager Benítez was replaced by Zidane on Monday after a disappointing seven-month, 25-match spell as manager. He won 16 games.Writing on his personal website, rafabenitez.com, he said: “I would like to wish good luck to Zinedine Zidane, my successor, and his staff. To all the players, coaches and staff in both Valdebebas and Bernabéu, I wish all the best and also good luck.”Benítez replaced Carlo Ancelotti in June, signing a three-year contact with his home-town club.But the 55-year-old found himself under increasing pressure due to some indifferent performances and damaging defeats, most notably the 4-0 home defeat by Barcelona in November.Benítez’s final game in charge was Sunday’s 2-2 draw at Valencia, a result which left Madrid in third spot in the Primera Division table, four points adrift of the leaders Atlético Madrid.The 10-time European champions then moved to remove Benítez and promote Zidane, but Benítez expressed no bitterness in his parting statement.“Now, at the end of my time as first team coach of Real Madrid, I would like to use this article to say goodbye to everyone at every level of the club. I want everyone at the club from the Board of directors, executives, workers and all of the fans, know that it has been an honour and privilege to be in charge at this club where I grew up as a person, player and coach from the lowest categories through to the first team.“As a Madridista from Madrid, steeped in the traditions and values of this institution, which I learned in the old sports city of Castellana, it has been an honour to work for these colours. I would especially like to thank everyone at the new sports city and the Santiago Bernabéu who since my first steps through the door have supported me and made my work easier. Thanks to all for helping.“With all that I have said still in mind, I would like to wish good luck to Zinedine Zidane, my successor, and his staff. To all the players, coaches and staff in both Valdebebas and Bernabéu, I wish all the best and also good luck. With all my respect and thanks... HALA MADRID and NOTHING ELSE.”

Eva Carneiro’s constructive dismissal case against Chelsea to have first hearing
~CONTENTS~
Eva Carneiro’s case for constructive dismissal against Chelsea will have its first tribunal hearing on Wednesday.The preliminary hearing will take place at the London South Employment Tribunal in Croydon and is expected to be in private before an employment judge.The hearing will fix the timetable for the case and deal with witness statements and disclosure of documents – including texts and emails – by each side, as well as any legal procedural disputes that exist between the two parties.A date for a full hearing could be fixed for some time in June but there may be another preliminary hearing arranged before that takes place. The parties may also agree to a settlement before the case is heard.Chelsea filed their defence last month. The former Chelsea team doctor also has a separate personal legal action against the club’s former manager José Mourinho, who left in December, for alleged victimisation and discrimination.The 42-year-old doctor was dropped from first-team duties after Mourinho criticised her and the first-team physio Jon Fearn for going on to the pitch to treat Eden Hazard on the opening day of the season.The action meant Chelsea were temporarily down to nine men against Swansea and Mourinho called Carneiro and Fearn ”impulsive and naive”. Carneiro did not appear on the bench again for first-team duties and later parted company with the club.Mourinho was cleared of using discriminatory language towards her following an investigation by the Football Association. Afterwards, Carneiro and the FA’s independent board member Dame Heather Rabbatts criticised the governing body for not interviewing the doctor as part of its investigation.Carneiro has also had backing from Fifa’s medical chairman Michel D’Hooghe, who contacted the doctor to offer his support and that of the world governing body. He has backed Carneiro’s insistence she was simply doing her job.

Poor old Rafa never seems to get any respect

~CONTENTS~
NEW ERA AT BERNABÉU #874,328Rafa Benítez won two La Liga titles and a Euro Vase at Valencia; orchestrated the most astonishing Big Cup win in history for the benefit of Liverpool; triumphed in the most exciting FA Cup final of the modern era; knocked Barcelona out of Big Cup on their own patch using players primarily interested in battering seven shades out of each other with golf clubs; became a world champion; and most impressively of all won a European trophy for Chelsea, a feat wholly beyond the ken of a certain other Iberian tactician who didn’t have to cope with the added pressure of 41,798 punters screaming eff, cee and effing cee at him every 12 seconds while he was trying to concentrate on his job.But despite it all, poor old Rafa never seems to get any respect. As well as having to put up with 41,798 punters screaming eff, cee and effing cee at him every 12 seconds while he was trying to concentrate on his job, he’s also repeatedly got it in the neck as a result of being a bit defensive; for not being very good at media patter; for once coming second best in the old mind games with Lord Ferg, a failure which puts him in an exclusive club known as Everyone; for looking at Him in a funny way; and for not having a similar body mass index to Keith Richards that time the Rolling Stones guitarist stayed awake for the entirety of 1972.It’s not much of a rap sheet, when you look at it dispassionately. But it’s been enough to get him the heave-ho from Real Madrid, who are burning through managers at such a rate that Sam Allardyce is statistically almost certain to be offered the chance he’s been dreaming of in March 2017, just after Leicester City put the Spanish giants out of Big Cup quarter-finals 5-0 on aggregate. Zinedine Zidane is the latest new man in charge, and has already been pictured smiling more ostentatiously during a training session than Benítez ever was, and in a more flattering tracksuit to boot. So well done everyone for achieving a couple of very important PR goals there.Zidane’s second task will be to convince Gareth Bale not to chip off in high dudgeon to Manchester United for £75m. But that’s a worry for another day, and Tuesday morning’s feelgood photo-op should at least buy him some time before the fans start impatiently demanding his dismissal for failing to turn the team into the second coming of Di Stéfano, Puskás and Gento. He’s good for at least three weeks.LIVE ON BIG WEBSITEJoin Scott Murray for red-hot MBM coverage of Stoke City 1-1 Liverpool in the Milk Cup semi-final first leg, from 8pm GMT.QUOTE OF THE DAY“Previously it’s always been [Lionel] Messi and [Him], it’s clearly them, but Neymar’s stepping up to the plate. I don’t know if he’s doing so because Messi has been out of the picture a bit, but I do think he’s got the same – or at least showing he will have the same – ability.

Feeling really quite ashamed I hurried to my feet, took one step forwards and tripped over the ball. If you’ve ever wondered what 25 people laughing at you feels like (and given you’re The Fiver, I’m sure you can only dream of such a number), then suffice it to say that two decades later it’s still ringing in my ears” – Matthew Flenley.“Good morning from a very cold Ontario. Just can’t help but wonder regarding The Fiver’s comment on yesterday’s Quote of the Day regarding the sluggishness of the three stripes of Manchester United and the team’s happiness with the kit deal.

A company well known for encouraging commercial partners to instigate change through positive statements, they were equally effusive about Fifa’s minor issues last year: ‘[We] look back on great moment such as the Fifa World Cup where we once again demonstrated what we are capable of when we focus and act with determination.

Sergio Agüero will not be rested for Manchester City’s tie against Everton
~CONTENTS~
Sergio Agüero will not be rested for Wednesday’s Capital One Cup semi-final, first leg against Everton while Wilfried Bony is injured, the Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini said.Agüero has been blighted by injuries this season, with Pellegrini easing him back over the Christmas period after his last knock against Southampton in late November. The Argentinian played nearly the full 90 minutes against Watford in the Premier League at the weekend, grabbing a dramatic late winner.“Bony has a kick in his calf so maybe he’s not fit for tomorrow. In a few days more he should be fine to come back,” Pellegrini said. “Sergio played three games in a week which was no problem for this moment.Pep Guardiola: ‘I need a new challenge, and I want to be a manager in England’ Read more“The last injury was not a muscle injury, just a pain in his heel. He’s fit and the best way for him to recover his best performance is to play games.”The Capital One Cup represents Pellegrini’s first chance of silverware of the season and the Chilean said playing the first leg of the semi-final away from home would be an advantage.“It’s always better to play away first so you know what you need in the second leg at home,” he said. “We must beat Everton, then we can think about the first title and then we think about the best way to start the FA Cup – we must focus game by game regardless of the competition.“Maybe it’s impossible to win all of the competitions but your attitude and desire and having a winning mentality indicates you must believe you can.”

QPR appoint former manager Chris Ramsey as new technical director
~CONTENTS~
QPR have appointed their former manager Chris Ramsey as technical director. The 53-year-old was sacked by the club in November, being replaced by Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink, but has now returned to Loftus Road.Ramsey was in charge of Rangers between February and November last year, winning nine of his 32 games as they were relegated from the Premier League last season.Hull gifted late win against QPR as Diomandé makes most of mix-up Read more“While we were disappointed things didn’t work out with Chris at first team level, we were determined to retain his services at QPR,” said the club’s director of football, Les Ferdinand. “As such, we actually put a clause in his contract which allowed us to retain Chris’s services in a player-development role should things not work out for him as head coach.“Chris knows academy football inside-out and having put the building blocks in place for a lot of the good restructuring work that’s been done here over the past 11 months, he can come in and make an instant impact in an environment he has helped build.”Ramsey will oversee coaching and coach education within the club’s academy and be responsible for developing and implementing player development strategies. He will also oversee the integration between the academy, development squad and first team, as well as focusing on the monitoring and reporting of players on loan to other clubs.Rangers are 16th in the Championship, with Ramsey’s replacement Hasselbaink yet to win in six games in charge.

Slaven Bilic deserves praise for turning West Ham into a hard-to-beat flair team
~~AUTHOR~~
Martin Laurence
~CONTENTS~
The Premier League largely reverted to the norm in the first weekend of the New Year. Arsenal, Manchester City, Manchester United and Chelsea all won, with Leicester City, Watford and Crystal Palace – the three real surprise packages of the campaign so far – failing to pick up three points. However, there was one “upset”.After a string of draws, West Ham have somewhat slipped under the radar after a remarkable start under Slaven Bilic. They’ve enjoyed a peculiar yet hugely successful season in the league, clinging on to their hopes of European football relatively unnoticed. Their win over Liverpool on Saturday was their second successive victory and took them above their opponents and Palace, as well as moving them three points clear of Watford and Stoke City.It looked like injuries to key players would derail their aspirations of a top-six finish but the fact that they are back in the race for Europe despite those absences is very impressive. Knowing that his side would lack the cutting edge they showed at the start of the season in the absence of Diafra Sakho, Manuel Lanzini and crucially Dimitri Payet, Bilic set about ensuring his side kept in the hunt by avoiding defeat.They, along with Palace, were one of only two teams to go unbeaten throughout December, doing so with a thoroughly depleted squad. They have conceded just twice in their last six matches, despite the absence of Winston Reid at the back, with James Collins in particular coming to the fore. Bilic’s decision to deploy a third centre-back in James Tomkins on the right of a back four, in place of Carl Jenkinson, further strengthened West Ham’s resolve and deserves recognition.While another injury lay-off for the impressive Lanzini is a blow, Payet’s return will improve their fortunes in attack. The Frenchman has excelled in the capital, earning the highest rating of any summer signing (7.59), enough to rank seventh in the league. Payet, who came on as a second-half substitute at the weekend, showed glimpses of class, eluding three Liverpool players with magnificent skill as the game drew to a close and creating two chances from just 12 touches. His ability to impact a game at any moment has really pushed West Ham on to become genuine European contenders.However, while the foreign imports to the club have impressed, the old guard deserve great credit for steadying the ship in their absence. The aforementioned Collins is West Ham’s highest rated player since the start of December (7.59) – enough to rank eighth in the league during that time. He dominated the ineffective Christian Benteke at the weekend, making a total of 23 clearances – the most by any player in a single game this season.Andy Carroll scored in back-to-back league matches for the first time in almost two years following his return from injury, with his rating of 8.77 bettered only by team-mate Mark Noble (9.22) in the Premier League at the weekend. Many felt that Noble’s days at his boyhood club may be numbered following the arrivals of Alex Song and Pedro Obiang but the 28-year-old captain has missed just one game all season, when he was suspended for picking up a red card in their 3-0 defeat of Liverpool at Anfield back in August.Andy Carroll comes good but Slaven Bilic warns him now is time to deliver Read moreBilic has found a successful balance between the new arrivals and the players who have served the club for years. He has maintained a happy camp, with the likes of Collins, Tomkins and Carroll determined to give their all when they have returned to the team. That much is easier said than done. Indeed, their Croatian manager has rotated his squad to such a degree – though enforced in a number of instances – that only Manchester United (28) have used more players than West Ham (26) this season.Impressive recruitment coupled with man-management and tactical nous from Bilic have left West Ham with just four defeats all season – with the last of those coming back in November. They are one of a few sides in the league who are not only hard to beat but also possess genuine flair. Hosting European football at the Olympic Stadium next season is still a distinct possibility. Their previous aim of ensuring they kept hold of their top-flight status for the big move seems a long way off.Premier League team of the week  Infographic: WhoScoredLa Liga team of the week  Infographic: WhoScoredAll statistics courtesy of WhoScored.com, where you can find live in-game data as well as player and team ratings.

Gareth Bale has no plans to leave Real Madrid but future hinges on central role

~CONTENTS~
Gareth Bale has no plans to leave Real Madrid in the wake of Rafael Benítez’s sacking but his future at the club will hinge largely on how Zinedine Zidane deploys him between now and the end of the season, and specifically whether he remains in a central role.Benítez’s dismissal on Monday came as a major disappointment to Bale, who enjoyed playing under the former Liverpool manager and respected the fact the Spaniard, backed by Florentino Pérez, the Madrid president, stayed true to his promise to play him through the middle rather than out wide.Zinedine Zidane admits pressure is on to win Champions League at Real Madrid Read moreBale, who has scored seven times in his past six appearances, wants to be used in a position where he can have the greatest influence on the game and any significant change to that approach under Zidane would have major ramifications for the world’s most expensive footballer.Zidane gave strong backing to Bale on Tuesday. “I understand he can be annoyed with the departure of Benítez because he [Benítez] was an important coach for him but he is going to have the same affection [from me] as with Rafa.“He is important for the squad, fundamental for the team. He’s phenomenal and what he has been doing recently is fantastic. I am going to give him all my affection and support so that he plays well for us.”Zidane was emphatic that he intends to play Bale, Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema. “Yes, I will play with the three. Yes. The idea is that. Clearly.”Although it remains to be seen how Zidane will set up the team, the manager’s message of support to Bale, who was the only player to miss Tuesday’s training session due to a slight muscle strain, is understood to have followed assurances from the Madrid hierarchy since Benítez’s departure that the Welshman remains key to the club’s plans. Pérez, in short, has no desire to sell the player.As for Bale, he is desperate to win La Liga – just about the only piece of silverware missing from his collection since joining Madrid from Tottenham Hotspur in 2013 – loves playing for the club and believes he could not be in a better place when it comes to trying to fulfil his ambition to one day win the Ballon d’Or.Yet there is no getting away from the importance he attaches to where he plays on the pitch, and Zidane, with whom Bale has never had much chance to build a relationship for no reason other than their paths have rarely crossed, holds a lot of cards in that respect.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest  Highlights from Zinedine Zidane’s first official press conference as Real Madrid manager and some facts about his career with the clubThere is no sense that anyone in Bale’s camp is overly anxious about the situation, and coming back to the Premier League is certainly not part of their thinking. At the age of 26, Bale is approaching his peak years, playing for Madrid is seen as being as good as it gets and the messages from those that matter inside the Bernabéu are always positive.Equally, there would be a frenzy of interest come the summer, including from Manchester City and Chelsea, if things unravelled under Zidane. Manchester United have monitored Bale’s situation closely for some time and would have the financial wherewithal, but they are highly unlikely to be at the top of the list given the state of affairs at Old Trafford.

Fifa’s secretary general Jérôme Valcke faces nine-year ban
~~AUTHOR~~
Owen Gibson
~CONTENTS~
Jérôme Valcke, the former right-hand man to the banned Fifa president Sepp Blatter, is facing a possible nine-year suspension from football after Fifa’s investigators said he had violated nine counts of its ethics code.The head of the investigatory arm of Fifa’s ethics committee, Cornel Borbély, recommended the nine-year ban and a 100,000 Swiss francs (£67,500) fine as it passed the case to the adjudicatory arm, headed by the German judge Hans-Joachim Eckert, for a final decision.Last month Blatter and Michel Platini, the Uefa president who was his heir apparent, were banned from football for eight years by Fifa’s ethics committee following an investigation into a £1.35m “disloyal payment”. Both men protested their innocence and said they would appeal.Valcke, the former secretary general, a key Fifa figure since he returned for his second spell at the organisation in 2007, was placed on indefinite leave in September after he was implicated in a scheme to sell World Cup tickets above face value and share in the profits. The plan was never enacted and Valcke denied the allegations.The Frenchman was later provisionally suspended for 90 days while Fifa’s ethics committee looked into the case, along with claims he facilitated a $10m (£6.8m) payment from the South African FA to an account controlled by the disgraced former Fifa vice-president Jack Warner. Valcke’s New York-based lawyers Kramer Levin said in a statement that the Frenchman had done “absolutely nothing wrong”.The statement said: “The investigatory chamber of the Fifa ethics committee has chosen to ignore Jérôme Valcke’s exemplary conduct and extraordinary contributions during his long tenure as secretary general. Today’s press release is nothing more than a self-serving public relations effort to wrongly attack Mr Valcke in a desperate attempt to try to prove that Fifa can police itself. Mr Valcke did absolutely nothing wrong as any independent and fair review of the facts would establish.”It is also understood the Fifa ethics committee has been examining allegations relating to Valcke’s expenses and, among other things, his use of a private jet.In a statement, the Fifa ethics committee said: “The chairman of the investigatory chamber recommended imposing a sanction of a nine-year ban and a fine of 100,000 Swiss francs on Mr Valcke for alleged violation of the general rules of conduct, loyalty, confidentiality, duty of disclosure, cooperation and reporting, conflicts of interest, offering and accepting gifts and other benefits, and general obligation to collaborate.“Until a formal decision is taken by the adjudicatory chamber of the ethics committee, Mr Valcke is presumed innocent.”Valcke’s 90-day suspension from all football-related activities ends at midnight on Tuesday but a 45-day extension has been requested by Borbély.Valcke had become a pivotal figure in Blatter’s administration, responsible for negotiating many of Fifa’s commercial and broadcasting deals. He quickly became indispensable to Blatter when he joined in 2003 as head of marketing and TV.In 2006, he left Fifa under cloud after being criticised by a New York judge for lying during contract negotiations with Mastercard but returned less than a year later as secretary general. Since then, he has delivered World Cups in South Africa and Brazil and been entrusted with shifting the Qatar 2022 World Cup to winter.But Valcke’s position became increasingly untenable in the fallout from the February raids in Zurich that precipitated Fifa’s near-collapse and the indictment of 35 football officials in the US on charges including money laundering, racketeering and tax evasion.By the time he was suspended, Valcke had already agreed to leave Fifa in February at the same congress at which Blatter had promised to hand over to a new president. Shortly before he was suspended, Valcke was understood to have sought to negotiate a multimillion-pound pay-off.Plates finally stop spinning for Fifa’s ‘Teflon’ man, Jérôme Valcke Read more

Zinedine Zidane admits pressure is on to win Champions League at Real Madrid
~~AUTHOR~~
Guardian sport
~CONTENTS~
Zinedine Zidane has admitted that the pressure is already on to win an 11th European Cup as he faced the press for the first time since taking over from the sacked Rafael Benítez.Gareth Bale has no plans to leave Real Madrid after Rafael Benítez’s sacking Read moreReal Madrid last won what they consider to be their holy grail in 2014, the year of “La Decima” when they beat Atlético Madrid 4-1 in the final, and will first see action in the Champions League under their French coach when they fly to Roma in the first round of the knockout stages on 17 February.“To win is absolutely essential in this group,” Zidane said of that game, “and I’m very aware of it.“We are in the last 16 and the target is always to win in the Champions League and will continue to be so and we’ll try to make it possible.”Asked about his emotions when he was handed the job by the president, Florentino Pérez, he said: “No coach is prepared, fully prepared, especially a coach who has never been to this level before, but I feel kind of prepared. I’ve got motivation, I’ve got hope and all that will help me.”Earlier in the day thousands of fans turned out to watch Zidane take charge of his first training session held at the Alfredo Di Stefano Stadium at Madrid’s training complex.The club traditionally opens its doors to the first practice session of the year and it estimated that 6,000 supporters turned up for the occasion.Zidane’s first game proper will be on Saturday at home against Deportivo La Coruna in the Spanish league. Real are third in the table, four points behind the leaders Atlético Madrid and two behind Barcelona.Comparisons have been drawn between Zidane’s appointment by Madrid and Pep Guardiola’s ascent to the top job at Barcelona in 2008 but the Frenchman dismissed those.“Guardiola is Guardiola. I will do all my best. Guardiola is a formidable coach. What he is doing is incredible. But I am not going to compare. I never did it as a player and I am never going to do it as a coach. What matters is the day to day, what I can give the squad. I am going to try to do all I can so that we work well.”Asked about the futures of James Rodríguez and Isco, Zidane said: “I’m going to say something: the whole team will be important, the whole squad. James and Isco who are two formidable players will be important for me, for the team, for everyone. We’ll see how we do that.”

Pep Guardiola: ‘I need a new challenge, and I want to be a manager in England’
~~AUTHOR~~
Guardian sport
~CONTENTS~
Pep Guardiola has alerted Manchester City, Manchester United and Chelsea to his availability by confirming he is leaving Bayern Munich in the close season so he can manage in the Premier League.The Spaniard’s desire to work in England has been an open secret but his public confirmation of this quickens the pace in the race to land a coach viewed by many as the world’s finest.Guardiola said: “I need a new challenge and I want to use that chance to be a manager in England. I want to experience the atmosphere in England and I look forward to the stadiums there. I am 44 and it is the right time. There are offers but I haven’t signed for anyone yet. When I have a new club I will let everyone know.”Privately, City are optimistic of persuading Guardiola to join them. Their manager, Manuel Pellegrini, signed a contract extension in the summer to June 2017 but given City’s admiration for Guardiola it seems unlikely the Chilean will remain, even if he guides the club to a second Premier League title in three years.Pellegrini was asked on Tuesday about Guardiola’s ambition to work in England. “I don’t have a reaction about that or feelings on other managers,” he said. Pushed on the issue again, he said: “It is a question I answered two weeks ago when I said no more about that.”When Guardiola was in charge at Barcelona he worked with Ferran Soriano, now City’s chief executive, and with the sporting director Txiki Begiristain. Guardiola remains in regular contact with Begiristain, in particular, and City believe this relationship can help to land the Bayern coach.The executive at the Etihad Stadium face a fight for him, though. United and Chelsea also would seriously consider appointing Guardiola. Louis van Gaal has eased the pressure a little on his position as United manager following the draw with Chelsea and Saturday’s victory over Swansea City. But the latter was a first win in nine games and although the Old Trafford hierarchy are supportive, the Dutchman’s job remains in the balance unless he can revive United’s title challenge.Chelsea need to appoint a permanent manager following the sacking of José Mourinho. Roman Abramovich, the owner, is keen to persuade Guardiola to replace the Portuguese as permanent manager. The club is being led by Guus Hiddink on an interim basis.Guardiola does not believe Bayern’s season will be affected by his decision. “The atmosphere in the Bayern squad is super and I will do everything I can to keep it that way,” he said.“I will give my absolute best until the end. If I was 60 or 65 I would have stayed but I think I am too young. It was a dream, it is a dream. I am very grateful to Bayern for this huge opportunity. I will not take any players. They have to stay here.”Premier League flashes cash at Pep Guardiola but does money always pay? | Paul Wilson Read more

~~TITLE~~
Rafa Benítez was not the solution for Real Madrid – he never had been
~~AUTHOR~~
Sid Lowe
~CONTENTS~
Real Madrid’s president, Florentino Pérez, did not accept questions when he appeared at the Santiago Bernabéu to announce the sacking of Rafa Benítez and the appointment of Zinedine Zidane on Monday night. Perhaps he thought there was nothing new to say. It is, after all, only six weeks since he called a press conference to denounce a “campaign” against the club and deny reports that he was contemplating making Benítez the 10th manager to leave during his presidency. Or maybe he just did not want to be asked any awkward questions, like: ‘Why?’In March Pérez called a press conference to insist angrily that he was not going to sack Ancelotti and to accuse the media of trying to “destabilise” the club. When, two months later, he announced the sacking of Ancelotti, he was asked why he was letting the Italian go; he had, after all, won the European Cup. “I don’t know,” Pérez said. In November he called a virtually identical press conference with the same accusations and the same message: Benítez had his total support. Six weeks later Benítez is the former manager. No one would be asking why this time.Some of the reasons are recurring ones, experienced by managers before Benítez, and there was something inevitable about this. Put bluntly, Benítez was the wrong manager for Madrid. At the press conference Pérez spoke for a minute and a half. He dedicated two sentences to Benítez, who was absent and had not yet been informed, then moved on to Zidane. There was applause for the new guy, barely a word for the old one. Rafa who? It was as if Benítez had never happened at all. In truth, there were few good memories.Zinedine Zidane back in Real Madrid spotlight after spell in the wings Read moreIt is 13 days since Pérez denied that he would sack his manager, insisting in a radio interview that Benítez was the “solution”. In November he had said: “Benítez has only just started work; let him work. He needs time.” He was not given time but, while this sacking arrives seven months to the day since he was presented – told, as Zidane was here, “this is your home” – it has not really come early. The surprise may even be that he lasted this long and that owes more to Pérez’s uncertainty about the alternatives, and an awareness of his own exposure, than a belief in Benítez. The former Liverpool manager had not even been the first choice; the job had been offered elsewhere first.The frustration for Benítez may be that, if he was going to get sacked one day, he should at least have been sacked doing something he truly believed in. Instead he died with somebody else’s boots on. Benítez is a manager who demands control; at the Bernabéu he did not have it, until it was too late. Compromise did not save him and adopting his master’s voice was no protection. He had been brought in to carry out a restructuring not entirely of his own design and, when that proved problematic, it was he who paid for it.The task set was a difficult one, always likely to end in failure. Benítez inherited a squad in which the heavyweights were so furious at the departure of Ancelotti as to say so publicly. They loved him whereas Benítez was the step-mother – a wicked one at that. His manner is to impose, to work and lay down rules, not to seek affection. Denis Cheryshev – whose selection in the Copa del Rey when ineligible led to Real’s expulsion – admitted that communication between players and manager was limited. Pre-season, one club captain had already clashed with him.Benítez had been brought in to break from the Ancelotti model, but there were contradictions in the vision. Pérez was convinced that Ancelotti did not work the players hard enough, that they needed a leader not a friend. With a dressing room like this one that was always likely to meet with some resistance, not least as one of Benítez’s other tasks was to tilt the team’s axis towards Gareth Bale, part of the president’s longer-term strategy.Virtually the first thing that Benítez did was visit Bale in Wales and talk to him about a new role as a No10 – the mocking nickname, incidentally, that some players applied to Benítez who never played professionally but told professionals what to do – and that was something that Ronaldo could not fail to notice. When Benítez refused simply to say “yes” when asked if Ronaldo was the best player he had ever coached, it should not have mattered but it did.Players saw the manager’s weakness, an authoritarian with no authority. The compromise was not comfortable and ultimately it did not help. The results were poor and performances worse. Madrid have not produced 90 minutes of good football against a decent team all year; Benítez was defensive about accusations that he was defensive but in truth the charge was simpler than that: his team was just not very good. They were not even good at the things his teams are supposed to be good at.No shock Rafael Benítez was sacked but odd it took Real Madrid so long | Sid Lowe Read moreBenítez lost the clásico 4-0 with a line-up that had been suggested to him. If he thought that would bring him safety, he was ultimately wrong. Short-term survival could not last long term, although momentarily Benítez hoped it might have strengthened his hand. Afterwards the president said publicly that “of course” the coach had complete freedom to choose the players he wanted. As it turned out, the “so long as they’re the right ones” went without saying – publicly, at least.James Rodríguez was a particular point of tension between president and manager. The latest galáctico, he was, like Bale, the future. But Benítez was not convinced. Against Valencia on Sunday night neither Rodríguez nor Isco played a single minute and that may have been as significant as the 2-2 draw. The day before Benítez seemed belatedly to decide that he might as well do it his way, when he announced that the “problem” was the attacking characteristic of the squad.The message had changed: the week before he had parroted the president’s conspiratorial line to insist that there was a campaign against him, Pérez and the club; now the analysis focused on the flaws sought on the inside. Benítez said he was looking for “balance,” just as Ancelotti had before him. In other words, this was an old problem: the president and the players. They were the problem, Benítez said. In doing so he became an even greater problem than he already was. He was no longer the solution. He never had been.

Football transfer rumours: Arsenal to sign Troy Deeney and Étienne Capoue?
~~AUTHOR~~
Paul Doyle
~CONTENTS~
Arsène Wenger might as well headbutt Graham Taylor and set fire to the whole back catalogue of Elton John. Because the Frenchman seems intent on tearing the heart – or, Troy Deeney – out of Watford. Watford’s burly striker, inspirational leader and likable raconteur has impressed the Arsenal manager by the way he has bullied and unpicked Premier League defences this season and now Wenger wants to separate Deeney from Odion Ighalo and make him a team-mate of Olivier Giroud instead. Because he’s gorgeous.Leicester City complete signing of Demarai Gray from Birmingham Read moreWhile such a move would be tantamount to spraying red and white paint all over that hornet statue outside the Harlequin Centre, Wenger reckons an offer of around £20m could make the transfer happen, and some Arsenal fans reckon that while shopping in the area, he should pick up Étienne Capoue, too.Manchester United, meanwhile, are to resume stalking Gareth Bale, who is said to be displeased by the dismissal of Rafael Benítez from Real Madrid, who could replace him with Eden Hazard. Chelsea would then seek to replace Hazard with Leroy Sané, Schalke’s 19-year-old sensation, who is also being eyed up Manchester City, Liverpool and Juventus. The bidding will start at £40m.Crystal Palace aim to bolster their challenge for the top by luring Jonjo Shelvey from Swansea and striker Benik Afobe from Wolves. Newcastle, meanwhile, want to bring Andy Carroll home, while Sam Allardyce wants to bring him to Sunderland to help relegate Newcastle. He wouldn’t, would he?Leicester are to resist any temptation to implant a chip in Jamie Vardy during his imminent groin operation to make him reject any offers from other clubs, a bit like that transplant that alcoholics can get to make them vomit out beer. But the Foxes will try to make Vardy stay with them by offering him a new contract worth more than double his current deal.Bournemouth are trying to persuade Patrick Bamford that a spell at the seaside is just what he needs to recover from his “terrible” stint at Crystal Palace.Rome? Lyon? Pah! Sandwell is where it’s at for Mathieu Debuchy, who is poised to spurn advances from AS Roma and Olympique Lyonnais and instead pledge his allegiance to West Bromwich Albion.Finally, Ronaldinho could be on his way to the Premier League. Finally! That, at any rate, is what his brother and agent Roberto intimated after the 35-year-old’s time at Fluminense came to an unhappy end. Roberto says that more than one Premier League club has mad an offer to Ronaldinho, but the Brazilian trickster is more likely to move to the United States or Asia.

Melbourne City lock in four rising stars with long-term deals
~CONTENTS~
Melbourne City have swooped to lock in key pieces of their A-League title assault, signing up four young Australians on long-term deals.Defenders Connor Chapman and Jack Clisby and versatile duo Paulo Retre and Jacob Melling have been offered new contracts to stay at the emerging A-League force for future campaigns after impressing in the season to date.Ninkovic A-League double hauls Sydney back for draw against City Read moreChapman’s new deal runs until the end of the 2018/19 season; Clisby, Retre and Melling have agreed terms to stay one campaign fewer.Chapman, 21, and Melling, 20, were both AIS graduates and the first signings after the club was bought by Abu Dhabi-based parent company City Football Group in 2014.Melling said he wanted to build a “great future” and win titles at City.“I’m developing here as a player and I’d like to stay here as long as I can,” he said. “The system they have here, the set-up is unreal.”The South Australian has brought energy and steel to City’s midfield and deputised in defence when their defensive stocks were low earlier this term.Retre, 22, did the same, deputising for Ivan Franjic at right-back until the Socceroo regained his fitness.The Melburnian scored the winner in the derby last month – his first A-League goal.Only Bruno Fornaroli has more outfield game-time for City this term, showing Retre’s growth under coach John van ‘t Schip.“Everyone’s looking to play games and play as much as they can,” Retre said. “I just want to keep building, developing, not just resting on my laurels.”Brisbane Roar keep up pressure at top of A-League with win over Melbourne City Read moreClisby, 23, raised eyebrows with his move to City from his local A-League side Perth Glory 12 months ago but has shown his worth by playing every position in City’s back-line this season.Chapman was poised to represent Australia at the under-23 Asian Championship beginning this month until he suffered a knee injury in December.The former Newcastle Jets backman has become an integral part of City’s defence since moving south.Van ‘t Schip called the four “some of the A-League’s emerging young talents”.“Connor, Jack, Paulo and Jacob have been an important part of the first team during the past two seasons, and their new deals are evidence of how key they have become to the senior squad,” he said.“We are delighted with their continued commitment to Melbourne City.”

Roberto Martínez: Everton’s win over Manchester City means nothing yet
~~AUTHOR~~
Paul Wilson
~CONTENTS~
Roberto Martínez refused to accept that Everton’s narrow win over Manchester City gives his side one foot in the Capital One Cup final, which was just as well considering Manuel Pellegrini fully agreed with him.Everton’s Romelu Lukaku pounces to leave Manchester City with uphill task Read more“It’s just a first-leg win, it means nothing yet, apart from the fact that when we had to win we showed that we could,” the Everton manager said. “The big positive from our point of view was the way we reacted to City’s equaliser. We went straight back up the field and scored again and that was very pleasing. We showed great character, we never accepted defeat, we played eye to eye against a really good City side.”The Manchester City manager pointed to two key refereeing decisions that could have gone in his side’s favour, but indicated he did not feel a 2-1 defeat was unrecoverable. “The first goal was absolutely offside because Romelu Lukaku was one yard in front of our goalkeeper, and in the second half we should have had a penalty when Jesús Navas was caught by Kevin Mirallas,” Pellegrini said. “But the referee didn’t whistle for either action so we lost 2-1. It is not the score we wanted, but we now just have to win at home 1-0 so I think we are able to play the final of the Capital One Cup. If you cannot win 1-0 at home then you do not deserve to reach a cup final.”Replays suggest Pellegrini might have had a point over the Navas penalty, though Martínez disputed the fact that Lukaku had been interfering with play when Ramiro Funes Mori followed up a Ross Barkley shot to open the scoring. “I don’t think the goalkeeper was impeded,” he argued. “He made a great save so he must have had a clear sight of the ball.”Everton’s Roberto Martínez gains respite after cup win over Manchester City | Paul Wilson Read moreBoth managers revealed injury worries for the next league game, which happens to be at the Etihad on Wednesday when the two sides meet again. City lost Eliaquim Mangala to a hamstring strain at half-time, which leaves them with only two fit centre-halves in Martín Demichelis and Nicolás Otamendi.Everton lost Lukaku and Tom Cleverley to ankle and calf injuries which will probably keep them out of FA Cup action at the weekend, though Martínez revealed he is most worried about Seamus Coleman, who has a pulled calf muscle and could be out for three or four weeks. “Even when we had to play with 10 men at the end we still kept the ball well,” Martínez said. “It shows how far we have come since losing to City in the league in August. We possibly lacked a little belief then, but now we are at full intensity.”

Everton’s Roberto Martínez gains respite after cup win over Manchester City
~~AUTHOR~~
Paul Wilson
~CONTENTS~
This has been called a topsy-turvy season, yet even so, who knew Everton knew how to defend? At Goodison too, where more goals have been conceded by the home side than anywhere else in the Premier League.Manchester City do not have the easiest attack to blunt, especially with Sergio Agüero back and looking close to peak sharpness, but Everton stood firm to take a slender advantage into the second leg of the Capital One Cup semi-final. That should ease some of the pressure on Roberto Martínez and some of the criticism of his players. Everton still have a lot to do at the Etihad, though here was evidence that Martínez’s talk of recovering from their lapses and learning from their mistakes may not have been the usual wishful thinking.You could tell these were nervous times at Goodison by the way Everton players took it in turns to stress the importance of the crowd in this fixture. More than one mentioned the necessity of turning the place into a bear pit in order to make life as difficult as possible for City. And a little bit easier for the home players, ran the unsaid subtext. A crowd united in hostility towards opponents cannot find time for griping at its own side, which has been happening noticeably over the last few weeks.This was Everton’s chance, a rare one these days, to give their supporters what Gordon Lee used to call a sniff of the Wembley hotdogs. Lee was the first manager to take Everton to the League Cup final, Martínez stands a chance of becoming the third. Perhaps more importantly he could still write himself into history as the first Everton winner, though he slightly missed striking the necessary can-do note by admitting beforehand that finishing in the top four would be more important than silverware this season. Managers of clubs who have seen precisely zero silverware in over 20 years should be careful of making statements like that, especially with the team languishing in the bottom half of the table.Everton’s resistance was all the more impressive considering there were periods early in the first half when the contest looked uneven. One piece of control by Agüero in the first few minutes was a statement of intent on its own, and when David Silva and Yaya Touré joined in, finding each other easily with precisely weighted passes, one feared for the home side. Yet, though initially out-thought, as they had been against Tottenham on Sunday, Everton refused to be overawed and refused to buckle.Martínez had indicated he wanted to see an end to the soft goals being conceded at home and there was nothing close to a goal for the visitors in the opening 45 minutes. For all City’s purposeful start they never succeeded in finding a way through their opponents, Joel Robles did not have a save of note to make before the interval. Willy Caballero was twice beaten by John Stones and Romelu Lukaku from offside positions before Ramiro Funes Mori just managed to beat the flag to snaffle a legitimate opener in stoppage time.What summed up Everton’s dogged resistance best was the sight of Muhamed Besic dispossessing Touré in full flow midway through the first half. Initially caught out by the Ivorian’s powerful surge, Besic refused to give up and stuck to Touré like a terrier snapping at the taller man’s heels. Just as the City player reached the edge of the area and shaped to part with the ball Besic whipped it from his toes and departed downfield with it, leaving Touré in a crumpled heap appealing for a free-kick that was never going to be given.Besic does not quite fit the School of Science template, but he is a thoroughly effective competitor. Agüero had a couple of half-chances snuffed out by Stones and Funes Mori before Everton took the lead, but the goal at the end of the first half was by no means out of the blue. Everton had held firm against City’s attacks, just as their manager had promised, and had been threatening Caballero’s goal before Ross Barkley produced a shot the goalkeeper could only parry.Barkley could have put a gloss on the Everton performance right at the start of the second half when his teasing ball across goal was only inches away from allowing Lukaku a tap-in, a miss the pair may have cause to regret in Manchester in a fortnight, even if the striker did restore his side’s lead after Jesús Navas had brought City level.It may be the case, a charge often levelled at Martínez teams, that Everton are still not quite clinical enough or ruthless in pressing home an advantage. Yet this was not a night for carping. Everton stood up for themselves, showed they can not only live with the best but come back against the best, and the home manager’s programme notes even contained a treasure for supporters who have begun to turn sceptical.“Like Spurs, we have seen too many draws,” he said, before offering perhaps the ultimate Martínez soundbite. “But all of them have been closer to victories than defeats.” Agree with him or not, there goes your glass half-full man.Football does not yet award any extra points for performances more deserving of a win than a draw, and even if it did, critics of Martínez might point out, it might then have to subtract a few for matches that were more like draws than victories, such as the one Everton won with the last action of the game at Newcastle United on Boxing Day, when Tom Cleverley’s header turned a scoreless stalemate into three points. This cup tie, to be fair, was not streaky or debatable. It was well won.And yes, Goodison was a bear pit. The atmosphere at the end was something to make all of Everton proud.

Didier Drogba retirement report premature despite links to Chelsea

But the former Ivory Coast striker took to Twitter to say that nothing has been decided.“Lovely to receive these messages but I have not yet announced my retirement & am still in discussion with @impactmontreal about my future,” Drogba tweeted.Drogba reportedly has a year to run on his contract with the Canadian side, who would be reluctant to let their talisman leave.The 37-year-old enjoyed an illustrious playing career across two spells at Stamford Bridge. He has been repeatedly linked with joining the Blues for a third time since Hiddink was appointed interim manager last month after José Mourinho left Chelsea for a second time.The former Ivory Coast striker, who watched the first match since the departure of Mourinho alongside Hiddink and Chelsea’s owner, Roman Abramovich, against Sunderland on 19 December, scored 164 goals in 381 appearances for the Blues. He struck 157 times in 341 appearances during his first spell, which concluded with the 2012 Champions League victory in Munich.

Jürgen Klopp’s criticism has spurred Liverpool on, says Joe Allen
~~AUTHOR~~
Stuart James
~CONTENTS~
Joe Allen has admitted that Liverpool’s players are hurt by their league position and frustrated with their inconsistency this season, but the Welshman hailed the desire and commitment on show in their Capital One Cup semi-final first-leg victory over Stoke City as the best possible response to Saturday’s meek defeat at West Ham United.Jordon Ibe’s first-half goal gives Liverpool a precious lead to take into the second leg at Anfield on 26 January and was the least that Jürgen Klopp’s side deserved after an impressive performance against Stoke that came on the back of the manager delivering some harsh criticism.Angry Jürgen Klopp claims Liverpool did not give 100% against West Ham Read moreAllen said that the players could have no complaints with Klopp’s comments in the dressing room at Upton Park. “It was just some frank words really, and I think as a team we needed to hear them,” the midfielder said. “But this team, this squad, has got great personality, great character, players who want to work hard, so there is no issue with that.“We knew we needed to respond at Stoke with a good performance first and foremost, with a performance that was full of commitment and desire, and we certainly got that. There’s been a couple of disappointing results recently and the work’s on now for us to get consistent and turn it around.”Manchester United, Manchester City and Chelsea have lost at the Britannia Stadium this season, yet Liverpool, who are eighth in the league and 12 points behind the leaders, Arsenal, played with intensity from the start and never allowed Stoke to impose themselves. Even the first-half injuries to Philippe Coutinho and Dejan Lovren, who both limped off with hamstring problems, failed to disrupt Liverpool’s rhythm.“It shows what we’re capable of,” Allen said. “You look at our position in the table and the points we’ve picked up and as a club it hurts us because I think we’re better than that. We’ve got the self-belief that we can do much better and I think this kind of performance shows that.“I think people have been a bit slow to give Stoke credit the last couple of years, I think people still associate them with the team they used to be but they’ve got some really good players. You see with some of the wins they’ve had this season what they’re capable of, we knew it was going to be a very, very tough game. So it makes it extra pleasing to get that clean sheet, go a goal ahead and now the onus is on them to come to Anfield and take the game to us.”Although Allen played for 79 minutes against Stoke, the 25-year-old has started only one league game this season, in the 2-0 defeat at Newcastle last month, and the new contract talks that started in March last year, when Brendan Rodgers was in charge, have stalled. With less than 18 months remaining on his deal, Allen’s future appears increasingly uncertain.Asked how he was feeling about that situation, Allen said: “That’s gone very quiet. I’m not too sure really. I’ve only made one league start this season, so I want to play more. I think that’s obvious for any player in that situation. From my point of view it’s just about knuckling down, doing my job and giving my best, which is always what I do.”

Marko Arnautovic casts doubt over Stoke future by rejecting contract offer
~~AUTHOR~~
Stuart James
~CONTENTS~
Marko Arnautovic’s future at Stoke City appears uncertain after he turned down the club’s opening contract offer in what threatens to turn into a game of brinkmanship.The striker, who has been such a revelation this season, is understood to be demanding a contract that is well above Stoke’s wage ceiling, meaning that talks have been put on hold for a few weeks.Arnautovic has less than 18 months remaining on his deal and Stoke remain hopeful they can reach an agreement with the 26-year-old to keep him at the club. The Austria international is Stoke’s leading scorer with seven goals and has produced some superb performances alongside Xherdan Shaqiri and Bojan Krkic as part of an exciting three-pronged attack.Stoke’s trident runs out of magic tricks as expectation turns into frustration | Stuart James Read moreStoke are determined to keep the trio together, recognise the contribution that Arnautovic has made this season and accept the player they paid little more than £2m for when they signed him from Werder Bremen in September 2013 is entitled to expect a wage hike. Yet they will not put themselves in a position where they are paying exorbitant salaries.Shaqiri is the club’s highest earner on around £70,000 a week and it would take a considerable leap of faith on Stoke’s part to go way above that figure to retain Arnautovic. Stoke are relatively relaxed about their position and although negotiations have been put on hold after the first round of talks, the club intend to revisit the situation soon and are hopeful they can reach a resolution that satisfies both parties. Arnautovic, however, will clearly have to lower his demands for that to happen.Mark Hughes alluded to Arnautovic’s contractual position before Tuesday’s 1-0 Capital One Cup semi-final first leg defeat at home against Liverpool, when the Stoke manager said: “We have had conversations with Marko and that is ongoing. We’re working our way through the squad and where we feel we can offer deals to our players. Marko is one of those players we’d like to do something with and it’s taking a little bit longer. It is what it is, but the intention is there to keep our good players if we can.”Arnautovic had a reputation for being a troublesome character when he arrived at the Britannia Stadium but Hughes has brought out the best in the Austrian, who will feature for his country at the European Championship.Hughes knows, however, that the next few months will be key when it comes to whether Arnautovic commits himself to the club or leaves them with little option but to consider offers come the end of the season.

~CONTENTS~

~CONTENTS~
Clint Dempsey was among the veteran stars left out of Jurgen Klinsmann’s training camp ahead of USA’s friendly games against Iceland and Canada – but Columbus Crew stars Tony Tchani and Ethan Finlay are in the squad for the first time.Michael Bradley, Jozy Altidore, Jermaine Jones and Matt Besler will attend camp on Monday in Carson, California, as will New York Red Bulls goalieLuis Robles, and Jordan Morris, the Stanford student who announced earlier this week that he would be turning professional. But Dempsey, Kyle Beckerman, Graham Zusi, Brad Evans and Chris Wondolowski did not make the cut.Former goalkeeper Brad Friedel appointed head coach of USA Under-19s Read more“This will be more an identification camp,” Klinsmann said in a statement. “It will be more a developmental camp. We want to give those players a head start into their very busy year 2016, but we also want to make it clear to them that it’s a huge opportunity that you have here.”Eleven players in the squad are eligible to play for the American under-23 team, which faces Colombia in a two-leg playoff in March for a berth in this year’s Olympics in Rio. The US Soccer Federation said several veterans are on “standby” for that game.Ten of the players called up by Klinsmann have never appeared for the national team: defenders Kellyn Acosta,Eric Miller, Tim Parker, Marc Pelosi and Matt Polster; midfielders Fatai Alashe and Tony Tchani; and forwards Ethan Finlay, Jerome Kiesewetter and Khiry Shelton.Tchani, who was born in Cameroon, was called up by ahead of World Cup qualifiers in November but withdrew because of an injury sustained in an MLS playoff game. Kiesewetter, who plays for Stuttgart in the Bundesliga, is the only player on the roster not based in the US.“We give the opportunity to the next wave of players to come in and make an impression and see if they are ready to step it up into international level.”USA play Iceland on January 31 and Canada on February 5, both in Carson.USA squadGoalkeepers: Bill Hamid (DC United), Luis Robles (New York Red Bulls).Defenders: Kellyn Acosta (Dallas), Matt Besler (Kansas City), Matt Miazga (New York Red Bulls), Eric Miller (Montreal), Tim Parker (Vancouver), Marc Pelosi (San Jose), Matt Polster (Chicago)Midfielders: Fatai Alashe (San Jose), Michael Bradley (Toronto), Mix Diskerud (New York City), Jermaine Jones (no club), Darlington Nagbe (Portland), Lee Nguyen (New England), Tony Tchani (Columbus), Wil Trapp (Columbus).Forwards: Jozy Altidore (Toronto), Ethan Finlay (Columbus), Jerome Kiesewetter (Stuttgart, Germany), Jordan Morris (no club), Khiry Shelton (New York City), Gyasi Zardes (Los Angeles).This article was amended to correct the name of the Red Bulls’ goalkeeper: he is Luis Robles, not Joel. The latter plays for Everton. This has now been changed.

Juventus overpower Verona to record eighth straight Serie A victory
~CONTENTS~
Juventus overpowered bottom-placed Verona 3-0 for an eighth straight league victory on Wednesday.Paulo Dybala put the defending champions in front with a curling free-kick after eight minutes and Leonardo Bonucci doubled the lead before half-time by redirecting another free-kick from Dybala with a header. Simone Zaza sealed it after being set up by Paul Pogba eight minutes from the end.“The lads did well to get right back into the league, which is never easy after the holidays,” Juventus manager Massimiliano Allegri said. “We weren’t very sharp, especially at the start, but we didn’t concede anything.“[Dybala] has been practicing free kicks. Being able to open up matches with a free kick is very important after a break of more than two weeks.”Juventus remained three points behind leader Inter, who won 1-0 at Empoli. Mauro Icardi found the target from close range in the first-half, redirecting a cross from Ivan Perisic.Having been joint top-scorer in Serie A last season with 22 goals, Icardi has eight goals from his 12 shots on target this term. Empoli, who had won four straight games, were dangerous at times but couldn’t find a way past Inter goalkeeper Samir Handanovic.Josip Ilicic scored twice against his former club as Fiorentina won 3-1 at Palermo. The Slovenia international put Fiorentina ahead in the 13th minute then scored again with an expert piece of control and a precise shot from outside the area.Torino work with their fans to resurrect their old home and honour their greats Read moreThe former Fiorentina striker Alberto Gilardino pulled one back for Palermo with a header in the 77th minute, but Jakub Blaszczykowski restored Fiorentina’s two-goal lead in added time.Napoli are third, level on points with Fiorentina, after beating Torino 2-1 with goals from Lorenzo Insigne and Marek Hamsik.Roma wasted a two-goal lead in a 3-3 draw at Chievo. Roma went ahead after seven minutes when the 18-year-old Nigerian Sadiq Umar scored his second goal in two matches after being set up by Gervinho. Umar also hit the post before Alessandro Florenzi doubled Roma’s lead in the 37th minute after intercepting a pass near midfield.Alberto Paloschi pulled one back for Chievo just before the break amid confusion in front of Roma’s goal and Dario Dainelli redirected a corner from close range to equalise shortly before the hour mark. Iago Falque restored Roma’s lead with a long, low, angled shot in the 81st minute, but Simone Pepe equalised again for Chievo in the 85th minute with a free-kick.At the San Siro, with Mario Balotelli still recovering from pelvis surgery, Milan were beaten 1-0 by Bologna, whose late winner came from Emanuele Giaccherini. Milan fans jeered Keisuke Honda, who reportedly criticised the club in an interview with the Japanese press, when he was replaced by Alessio Cerci midway through the second half.Lazio drew 0-0 at home to Carpi, Sassuolo and Frosinone drew 2-2, while, earlier, Udinese beat Atalanta with first-half goals from Cyril Thereau and Stipe Perica to celebrate the opening of their redesigned Stadio Friuli.

Everton’s Romelu Lukaku pounces to leave Manchester City with uphill task
~~AUTHOR~~
Andy Hunter
~CONTENTS~
Manuel Pellegrini’s problems with Catalonian coaches do not cease with Pep Guardiola. Roberto Martínez called on Goodison Park to overcome recent anxieties, show faith in his Everton team and intimidate Manchester City in the Capital One Cup semi-final. His players obliged too, and the tantalising prospect of an all-Merseyside final remains alive following a merited first-leg victory over the competition favourites.Roberto Martínez: Everton’s win over Manchester City means nothing yet Read more“I wouldn’t be that foolish,” said the Everton manager when asked to entertain the idea of facing Liverpool at Wembley next month. A wise move.Goals from Ramiro Funes Mori and the irrepressible Romelu Lukaku, his 19th of the season, sandwiched a rare composed finish from Jesús Navas to give Martínez the advantage he craved and the tangible reward he needed to convince the growing doubters. But both semi-finals remain precariously balanced and it was a confident – though aggrieved –Pellegrini who stated afterwards that City required only a 1-0 win at the Etihad Stadium to advance (after extra time) and would not deserve to reach Wembley if they fell short. “That’s why I trust us absolutely,” added a manager who will spend the rest of the season under the spectre of Guardiola regardless of what he achieves.Pellegrini was adamant Everton’s opening goal should have been disallowed for offside and that Navas should have had a penalty for a clip from Kevin Mirallas, whose careless substitute’s display contrasted starkly with the composure and confidence shown by his team-mates. Only the penalty claim had substance. City were again largely subdued away from home and there could be little complaint at the outcome. Everton ended with 10 men after Seamus Coleman limped off with all three substitutes deployed but there was no late flourish from a visiting team who, with Fernando replacing Kevin De Bruyne after the Irish defender’s departure, appeared content to settle for 1-2.As against Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday, Martínez’s men sat deep initially to plug the gaps that have led to 20 goals being conceded at Goodison in the Premier League – no team has let in more at home this season – and allowed the visitors to control possession in central midfield. City began confidently and with purpose but the pattern changed once the restored Muhamed Besic, who was impressive again, began to stamp his authority on the midfield battle, flicking the ball over the head of David Silva and rousing the home fans with a fully-committed, clean tackle on Yaya Touré for good measure.Manchester City stretched by movement of Everton’s Ross Barkley and Gerard Deulofeu | Michael Cox Read moreGareth Barry again provided the brains in the operation. Both managers persisted with their cup keepers, Joel Robles sparing Tim Howard another run-in with his critics on the Gwladys Street and Willy Caballero replacing Joe Hart, but neither had a save to make until Everton opened the scoring in first-half stoppage time. The goal had been coming.Everton served notice of their intent when Gerard Deulofeu slipped Lukaku into the visitors’ area only for the striker’s first touch to enable Nicolás Otamendi to intervene. The home side then had two goals disallowed for offside in the space of five minutes, rightly so on each occasion. Barry and Funes Mori were both beyond the last defender when Leighton Baines floated a free-kick to the far post where the former City midfielder headed back for John Stones to convert from close range. Lukaku also beat Caballero but was two yards behind the visiting back-line when he received a pass from Deulofeu.It was a case of third time lucky for Everton when Tom Cleverley delivered an inswinging corner from the right on the stroke of half-time. Barry was again first to the cross, glancing on to Ross Barkley who, despite injuring his foot early in the game, unleashed a powerful drive that Caballero parried into the path of Funes Mori. Lukaku was offside when Barkley struck but the Argentina defender was not and gleefully swept home his first goal at Goodison.Everton’s Roberto Martínez gains respite after cup win over Manchester City | Paul Wilson Read moreCity had barely troubled the Everton goal before the interval. Otamendi headed wide from a De Bruyne corner while a combination of Stones, Robles and Funes Mori prevented Sergio Agüero capitalising on slips from Barkley and Baines. Otherwise, their bright start faded and prompted Pellegrini to make two substitutions before the hour mark, Martín Demichelis replacing the hamstrung Mangala at half-time and Jesus Navas injecting his pace at the expense of Fabian Delph. The latter change was to have the intended effect.Agüero sliced wide, Fernandinho headed straight at Robles and De Bruyne forced a smart save from the Spanish keeper as Everton were pressed back. The counterattack suited the hosts, with Barkley breaking several times only to lack the killer final touch, but they were undone by one from their own corner as City levelled late on. Touré’s clearance found Agüero who spun superbly away from Coleman and threaded a pass behind an exposed home defence for Navas to beat Robles.The City celebrations were still in full swing when Everton retook the lead. Baines, Barkley and Barry combined on the left, the veteran midfielder swept a delightful cross over the head of Demichelis and Lukaku was perfectly placed to head home his 19th goal of the campaign, injuring himself in the process. Everton need him fit desperately. Pellegrini needs, and expects, a reaction from City.

Manchester City stretched by movement of Everton’s Ross Barkley and Deulofeu
~~AUTHOR~~
Michael Cox
~CONTENTS~
This was a stereotypically cautious first leg between two teams determined to dominate possession. It is to Everton’s great credit that their attacking players offered more variety with their positioning and stretched the opposition defence more – and as the game opened out, the home side looked much more threatening.Manuel Pellegrini omitted his two natural wingers, Jesús Navas and Raheem Sterling, and instead fielded David Silva and Kevin De Bruyne in the wide roles, with Yaya Touré at the head of a midfield triangle. Inevitably, Silva and De Bruyne came inside, helping City to retain the ball in central positions but offering little penetration.Everton’s Romelu Lukaku pounces to leave Manchester City with uphill task Read moreSergio Agüero tested Everton’s offside line with runs in behind but City appeared too content to play in front of the opposition defence, relying too much on the full-backs for forward running. Things looked much better in the second half, when the substitute Navas stretched the play down the right, and it was fitting that the Spanish winger netted a rare goal, after being played in by Aguero on the counter-attack.Everton struggled to get going, but once they enjoyed spells of possession, it was clear Roberto Martínez’s side were causing City serious problems. Tom Cleverley aped the movement of Silva and De Bruyne by playing narrow, almost as an extra central player, but it was notable he looked forward quickly when he received possession – hitting a couple of long balls towards Romelu Lukaku, as he did during Everton’s 1-1 draw with Tottenham Hotspur at the weekend, when this route of attack created Aaron Lennon’s opener.On the opposite flank, Gerard Deulofeu provided something unique: natural width. He spent much of the first half near the touchline and while his crossing was poor – the first drilled into the sidenetting, the second woefully overhit – his positioning stretched City. It caused Gaël Clichy positional problems and increased the gap in the channel between Clichy and Eliaquim Mangala, where Lukaku spent much of the first half.Everton v Man City: Capital One Cup semi-final first leg – as it happened Read moreRoss Barkley, too, impressed with his movement. Somewhat overshadowed by Spurs’ Dele Alli, here he took up more intelligent positions between the lines and varied his movement to drift wide when City’s full-backs were drawn out of position. He especially liked drawing left, from where he slid an inviting ball across the six-yard box at the start of the second half which narrowly evaded Lukaku – although the Belgian was, not for the first time, offside.Later, he beat Nicolás Otamendi in the left-hand channel before firing at Willy Caballero, and then went on a mazy run from the same position before being dispossessed just as he was about to shoot.We know Everton can offer attacking flair and therefore arguably their performance without the ball was more impressive. Against a side using multiple playmakers, the defensive-minded combination of Gareth Barry and Muhamed Besic worked well, with the former using his knowledge of his former teammate Touré to largely nullify him, and the latter playing a more dynamic, tough-tackling midfield role. Ramiro Funes Mori and John Stones had the pace to keep a high line against Agüero, while the full-backs Leighton Baines and Seamus Coleman played more cautiously than usual, and were protected well by Deulofeu and Cleverley.Many sides would have settled for 1-0 but Everton continued to push forward deep into the second half. Getting caught out on a counterattack from an attacking set piece was a frustrating way to let City back into the game, and Everton were rather fortunate to retake the lead through Lukaku’s header. Martinez’s side are adept at attacking but their inability to manage games remains a major weakness.

Januzaj was selected only for Europa League games.During David Moyes’s tenure two seasons ago Janzuaj was one of the few successes, breaking into the side with some match-winning displays. Yet following Moyes’s sacking in April 2014 Januzaj gradually slipped from the first-team reckoning.Januzaj’s lack of success at Dortmund will be a particular disappointment. When on holiday in Dubai last summer he – along with Luke Shaw – took a personal trainer to try to attain optimum sharpness before the new season.There is no plan to recall James Wilson from Brighton & Hove Albion despite Van Gaal’s lack of striking options.

Tottenham Hotspur are on the verge of signing teenager Shilow Tracey from Ebbsfleet United. The 17-year-old was invited for a trial in October and travelled with the club’s under-18s to play at the IMG Cup in Florida last month.Lille’s Sofiane Boufal a target for several English clubs in the summer Read moreTracey scored twice in victories over Jacksonville Armada and Baltimore Celtic, leaving Spurs suitably impressed to open talks with Ebbsfleet over a permanent move. Tracey is expected to seal his switch by the end of the week.It is believed Ebbsfleet have been pleased with Tottenham’s handling of the transfer and the Vanarama National League South side are keen to maintain a close relationship between the clubs.Tracey is comfortable playing either in central midfield or further forward behind a striker, although he has only featured once for Ebbsfleet’s first team.The deal would continue Tottenham’s policy of putting trust in young talent following the success of players like Harry Kane, Dele Alli, Eric Dier, Ryan Mason and Nabil Bentaleb under Mauricio Pochettino. Ebbsfleet, however, play five tiers below the Premier League and Tracey is likely to stay with Spurs’ academy for the rest of this campaign.Tottenham’s priority in the transfer window remains adding another striker to provide cover for Kane, who has played in all but one of the club’s 27 games this season. One reported target was the Marseille forward Michy Batshuayi but any hopes of a January switch look to have ended after the Belgian signed a new contract with the French side until 2020.

Ljubljana reject Harry Redknapp because ‘there is too much at stake’

Olimpija Ljubljana have decided against trying to bring in Harry Redknapp as manager because the club’s president Milan Mandaric believes it would be too much of a risk.The Slovenian league leaders were taken over by the former Portsmouth, Leicester and Sheffield Wednesday owner last summer and have been without a manager since Marijan Pusnik’s departure in December.Olimpija director Ranko Stojic last week confirmed surprise reports that the former Portsmouth, Tottenham and QPR manager was a candidate, saying Redknapp could head to Ljubljana if he decided against “an offer from the Arab world”.The relationship struck up between Redknapp and Mandaric during their time at Fratton Park was key to such a deal, but the president has decided against trying to bring him to the Stozice Stadium.“We cannot afford the slightest error because there is too much at stake,” Mandaric said on the club’s website.“We need someone for whom the Slovenian football environment is not foreign. It would therefore be pointless at this stage to engage experts from Western Europe. I know that there has recently been debate about the arrival of my good friend and former colleague at Portsmouth, Harry Redknapp. I can assure you that [it will not be him] because we cannot afford too many risks.”

The baby named Arsenal backwards – and other kids who took one for the team

~CONTENTS~
Never marry a football fan. That is the message from Australia, where – according to a letter in a magazine that has gone viral online – a mother discovered two years too late that the “unique and romantic” name Lanesra that her husband picked for their daughter, was his football team Arsenal spelled backwards.Some might say the little girl got off lightly – at least Lanesra sounds like a name. In Norway, a Liverpool FC-loving couple made headlines in 2015 for giving their daughter the exotic name YNWA (pronounced Yee-nwa if that helps) – the acronym for club song You’ll Never Walk Alone. While it might sound slightly dubious to burden your child with their parents’ obsession, the reason was a sweet one: the couple feared their baby would not survive her difficult birth, so wanted the name to symbolise “that her mum and dad will always be here for her”.But the beautiful game doesn’t always inspire a beautiful name. In 1966, a Liverpool supporter called his newborn after every player in the 1965 FA Cup-winning team – including the manager and two assistants. Pity the poor teachers who had to take the register for Paula St John Lawrence Lawler Byrne Strong Yeats Stevenson Callaghan Hunt Milne Smith Thompson Shankly Bennett Paisley O’Sullivan. Even worse, her mother only discovered her daughter’s unusual name when she came out of hospital – and said she was “disgusted” at her husband’s choice. Mainly because, although her husband was football mad, she had never watched a match in her life.Father names baby son Bermondsey Millwall Den without telling his wife Read moreLast October, Millwall fan Mike Bloomfield took a similar gamble, sneaking off to register his son’s birth without telling his wife what he had planned. Despite living metres away from Crystal Palace’s Selhurst Park, the Croydon-based builder defiantly called his child Bermondsey Millwall Den Bloomfield to encompass the name of his beloved team’s ground (the Den) as well as its location. “We wanted a name that stuck out,” he says. “I was born and bred in Bermondsey and Millwall has always been my football team. Den was my wife’s father’s name too.”His wife, he says, with some understatement, was a little surprised. “It was a dangerous thing to do, but she loves the name now.”But, he says, unlike the father of baby Lanesra, he would never have waited two years to tell her the truth: “That’s the coward’s way out!”

The 19-year-old Grujic has signed a four-and-a-half year deal at Anfield but will be loaned back to Serbia’s league leaders for the remainder of the season.“We’re very pleased because Marko is a big talent and we’ve seen him a lot of times,” Klopp told Liverpool’s website. “When I came here, our scouts showed me some footage of a very skilled player from Red Star Belgrade. We watched it, we spoke to him, we met each other – he’s a good boy, a young boy but plays an important role at Red Star, who are the best team in Serbia.”Liverpool are also considering their options for a central defender in January having finished Tuesday’s Capital One Cup semi-final win at Stoke City with all of their available, experienced options injured. Tiago Ilori is expected to return from Aston Villa once his season-long loan deal is cancelled but is not viewed as a long-term solution while Joël Matip, the Schalke defender who is out of contract in the summer, has yet to decide on his future.

The announcement comes a day after the pathology evidence on all 96 people who died at Hillsborough was completed at a new inquest in Warrington. The jury is expected to begin considering its verdict from 22 February.The chair of the HFSG, Margaret Aspinall, said: “The 96 will never be forgotten. It is likely that the inquests will be concluded before the anniversary so this final memorial service will provide the families with some closure. The HFSG would like to thank everyone for all the support the families have received over the past 27 years and all those people who have attended the service at Anfield each year.“We would also like to extend our thanks to Liverpool Football Club for their continued support over the past 27 years and for hosting the service each year at Anfield. We hope that the public and fans respect the decision of the HFSG and will continue to remember the 96 in their own perhaps more private way.”

Eva Carneiro to fight on after failing to reach Chelsea settlement
~CONTENTS~
The former Chelsea team doctor Eva Carneiro will continue her legal battle against the club after failing to reach a settlement at the first hearing in her constructive dismissal case.Carneiro, 42, was joined by her husband, the polar explorer Jason De Carteret, at London South Employment Tribunal in Croydon for a private preliminary hearing before an employment judge.Eva Carneiro case is test of integrity and game must not shy away | Anna Kessel Read moreShe is claiming constructive dismissal after she was dropped from first-team duties and later parted company with the club following criticism from the manager José Mourinho.Carneiro and the first-team physiotherapist Jon Fearn were branded “impulsive and naive” by Mourinho after they ran on to the pitch to treat Eden Hazard on the opening day of the season, leaving Chelsea temporarily down to nine men against Swansea.Following the three-hour hearing, Mary O’Rourke QC, representing Carneiro, said no settlement had been reached and a date had been fixed for the next hearing. Carneiro made no comment as she left the tribunal holding hands with her husband.A date for the full tribunal is expected for some time in June but a court spokesman refused to reveal a date for the next hearing. “It was a private hearing and what happened in the hearing is a private matter,” the spokesman said.The hearing was expected to fix the timetable for the case, and deal with witness statements and disclosure of documents including texts and emails by each side, as well as any legal procedural disputes that exist between the two parties. Chelsea filed their defence in the case last month.Carneiro also has a separate personal legal action against Mourinho, who left Chelsea in December, for alleged victimisation and discrimination.Mourinho was cleared of using discriminatory language towards Carneiro following an investigation by the Football Association.Afterwards, Carneiro and the FA’s independent board member Dame Heather Rabbatts criticised the governing body for not interviewing the doctor as part of its investigation.Carneiro has also had backing from Fifa’s medical chairman Michel D’Hooghe, who contacted the doctor to offer his support and that of the world governing body. He has backed Carneiro’s insistence that she was simply doing her job.

NO DEFENCE FOR KLOPPPhilippe Coutinho holding out a hand for help. Dejan Lovren rolling around in extreme distress, limbs forcibly manipulated by members of the emergency services. Kolo Touré splayed on the floor clutching a pint. It’s a contemporary scene of human carnage that has been compared to some of the great works of Renaissance art, the paintings of Bruegel, the cartoons of Hogarth. Manchester on New Year’s Eve had nothing on the state of Liverpool a few days later. Jürgen Klopp’s side came away from Stoke on Tuesday evening with a precious first-leg lead in the semi-final of Hardaker’s Folly, but it came at a heavy cost. Liverpool now have 11 players on their injury list, an unfortunate situation sure to have serious repercussions before a flirt with humiliation at Exeter and back-to-back games against Arsenal and Manchester United. Not only that, you can hardly swing a cat in the treatment room, and there are worries that if Daniel Sturridge is asked to budge up to make a little space just one more time, the bones of his arse may break into fragments so small you’d be able to sieve them through the bright-red gusset of a pair of New Balance breeks.These many maladies are naturally being blamed on the new man Klopp, who like water and broccoli inventor Arsène Wenger in the late 1990s, has brought a brand-new, previously unheard-of concept to England: the sore leg. Unless this crazed madman stops telling his players to physically exert themselves and make challenges, Liverpool’s woes are likely to get worse and worse as a busy month continues to unfold. With this in mind, the club are in discussions with Aston Villa for the return of the on-loan Tiago Ilori, a player who has yet to feature for Liverpool’s first team, and has been unable to break into a defence that’s already let in 42 goals this season. That it’s come to this for a famous old club who could once call on the services of Phil Babb, Bjorn Tore Kvarme, Djinkin’ Djimi Traoré and Torben Piechnik.LIVE ON BIG WEBSITEJoin Scott Murray for red-hot MBM coverage of Everton 2-3 Manchester City in the Coca-Cola Cup semi-final first leg, from 8 pm GMT.QUOTE OF THE DAY“The ones who said I was finished don’t understand anything.

I accompanied my dad to a Sunday League match in Hull, where, to my horror, I was called upon late in the second half to replace a knacked striker. Being a young shaver-me-lad of 19, against a tiring defence of portly 40-year-olds, I soon sprung an offside trap to run clear on goal, but while attempting my blooter into the top corner, I kicked my own toe and spooned the ball over. Looking down in shame, I saw that, in my enthusiasm, I had put my size 10-and-a-half foot through the toe of the size 9 boot of the stricken striker that I had replaced, forcing me not only to also depart the match, but also to present the already knacked and irritated player with his Adidas Predators, or what was left of them.

Lille’s Sofiane Boufal a target for several English clubs in the summer
~~AUTHOR~~
Ed Aarons
~CONTENTS~
Lille’s Sofiane Boufal is a transfer target for Arsenal, Manchester United, Tottenham and Manchester City, although the winger is unlikely to be allowed to leave in the January window.The 22-year-old, who has scored five goals in Ligue 1 so far this season, has been heavily scouted by several clubs in England, Spain and Italy over the last few months after his impressive displays for the French side. However, with Lille currently struggling in mid-table, it is expected that they will resist any offers to sell their prized asset this month despite ongoing financial difficulties at the club.Belgium striker Michy Batshuayi signs new contract with Marseille Read moreBoufal, who was signed from newly-promoted Angers last January for an undisclosed fee believed to be around €4m, is now valued at around €25m (£18.3m) by Lille. Although sources close to the player insists he is “99% certain” to stay in France this month, the club are understood to be willing to cash in at the end of the season.The reigning French champions Paris Saint-Germain are also believed to have registered an interest in Boufal, who came through the youth system at Angers and has yet to represent either France or Morocco – for whom he qualifies through his parents – in a competitive match.Tottenham are understood to have been the first Premier League club to have scouted the player who has been compared to former Lille forward Eden Hazard in the past, although scouts from Arsenal, United and City have also been in attendance at recent matches. Boufal is said to be relaxed about his future, with his club having only appointed manager Frédéric Antonetti at the end of November.Asked last month about the prospects of Boufal leaving in January, Antonetti warned him against making any rash decisions. “I see a lot of failures in departures,” he said. “Because sometimes they go a little too early. I am not afraid of losing Sofiane Boufal in January, because of all the discussions I had with him. He has many things to learn. In a club like Lille, he can move forward.”Meanwhile, Angers have yet to receive any concrete bids for Boufal’s former team-mate Romain Thomas. The defender is wanted by both Crystal Palace and Stoke having impressed in his side’s rise to third place in Ligue 1 this season.

Sunderland close in on Bayern Munich defender Jan Kirchhoff
~CONTENTS~
Sam Allardyce is closing in on his first January signing after the Bayern Munich defender Jan Kirchhoff arrived in the north-east for a medical.The 25-year-old headed for Sunderland after being left out of the Bayern squad who flew to Qatar for a mid-season training camp on Wednesday.Bayern said: “The travelling party does not include Jan Kirchhoff, who is away with his agent concluding negotiations for a possible transfer.”Kirchhoff appears to be surplus to requirements in Munich after spending last season on loan with their Bundesliga rivals Schalke, with injuries having limited his involvement at the Allianz Arena.He has made just 10 appearances for the club in the two and a half years since he signed from Mainz, all of them as a substitute and just one this season in the 1-0 German Cup victory over Darmstadt last month.Allardyce’s concentration on defenders – he has also been heavily linked with Lorient’s Lamine Koné – is understandable with Younès Kaboul’s hamstring injury set to sideline him into February, an absence which has prompted the 36-year-old Wes Brown’s return to the team for the last two games.The captain John O’Shea is also approaching the end of his career at 34 and whatever role the senior pair have to play during the remainder of the current campaign, they will need to be replaced sooner rather than later.Sunderland have conceded 39 goals in their 20 Premier League games this season and scored just 22, and their failings at both ends of the pitch have left them in 19th place, four points shy of safety.Allardyce has traditionally built from the back and while getting the best out of his strikers is also a focus, he is convinced that clean sheets will provide the foundation for yet another survival bid.Meanwhile, Sunderland have been credited with an interest in the Italy striker Ciro Immobile, currently on loan at Sevilla from Borussia Dortmund.

Liverpool crisis down to Jürgen Klopp’s pressing game, says Sam Allardyce
~~AUTHOR~~
Andy Hunter
~CONTENTS~
Sam Allardyce has blamed Jürgen Klopp’s demand for a high-intensity pressing game for the injury crisis afflicting Liverpool.Liverpool have 11 players injured, six with hamstring problems of varying degrees, after Philippe Coutinho and Dejan Lovren joined their list in the first half of Tuesday’s Capital One Cup semi-final win at Stoke City. The club have yet to discover the full extent of Coutinho’s and Lovren’s hamstring strains.Liverpool running more under Jürgen Klopp than with Brendan Rodgers Read moreWith Kolo Touré hobbling at the end of the 1-0 win, albeit with cramp according to the former Ivory Coast international, Klopp could be without all four of his established central defenders at Exeter City on Friday in the FA Cup third round.Liverpool have suffered 24 separate injuries during Klopp’s three months in charge and Allardyce, who last week accused the former Borussia Dortmund coach of being “a soft German” for complaining over the tackle that injured Mamadou Sakho’s knee at Sunderland, has pinned the cause on the manager’s tactics.The Sunderland manager, echoing Graeme Souness’ post-match comments on Sky, told TalkSport: “That is him [Klopp] asking his players to play a high-tempo pressing game from the top end. It’s great that the players have been able to carry it out but I think it has kicked in now.“I don’t think Jürgen has realised just how ferocious our league is at this period of time and because he has asked for that extra high energy, that extra 10 yards, these lads are fatiguing now with so many games in such a short period of time and are picking up these muscle strains. They are highly trained athletes more than ever before, and they become more susceptible to injuries by the amount of work they do in a game now.”Klopp dismissed suggestions that Liverpool’s training regime was to blame, wryly stating: “We don’t train, we only recover,” due to the hectic fixture schedule. The semi-final first leg was Liverpool’s fourth competitive game in 11 days.Allardyce reiterated his stance that a winter break would benefit clubs and players in the Premier League. He added: “I still hark on about having a break at this time to lessen the workload on players. As a league and as a country we should look at helping the players along the way. Stoke played the same team fourth game in a row and the lads looked like they couldn’t run.”

Liverpool sign 19-year-old Marko Grujic from Red Star Belgrade for £5.1m

Andy Hunter
~CONTENTS~
Liverpool have completed the £5.1m transfer of the Serbian midfielder Marko Grujic from Red Star Belgrade. The 19-year-old has signed a four-and-a-half year deal at Anfield but will be loaned back to Serbia’s league leaders for the remainder of the season.Liverpool ask to cancel Tiago Ilori’s season-long loan at Aston Villa Read moreInternazionale and Chelsea were among other clubs interested in Grujic, part of the Serbia squad who won the Under-20 World Cup last year, but the playmaker opted for Liverpool following a personal intervention from Jürgen Klopp. The Liverpool manager moved for the first signing of his Anfield reign at the request of his assistant Zeljko Buvac and a deal was agreed in principle during talks in Belgrade before Christmas.Red Star insisted on retaining their academy graduate for the rest of this season’s title challenge and attempt to qualify for the Champions League.“We’re very pleased because Marko is a big talent and we’ve seen him a lot of times,” Klopp told Liverpool’s website. “When I came here, our scouts showed me some footage of a very skilled player from Red Star Belgrade. We watched it, we spoke to him, we met each other – he’s a good boy, a young boy but plays an important role at Red Star, who are the best team in Serbia.“To describe him, I would say he’s a tall boy but quick and good at technical things. He can play passes and can dribble. But he is young, so he has to develop. He will do this, so everything is OK.”Grujic had a medical on Merseyside on Monday and is due to return to Liverpool for pre-season training in July.Liverpool running more under Jürgen Klopp than with Brendan Rodgers Read more“I’m very excited and so proud to be here,” Grujic said. “I can’t wait to get started, play at Anfield and train at Melwood. I was thinking about my progress in my next period and decided it was good for me to come here to try to be the best I can. I want to play in front of one of the loudest set of fans in Europe at Anfield.“I also like the atmospheres at other stadiums, the crowds are very good. I like to play under pressure and that’s why I’ve come here – because it brings out the best in me.”Liverpool are also considering their options for a central defender in January having finished Tuesday’s Capital One Cup semi-final win at Stoke City with all of their available, experienced options injured. Tiago Ilori is expected to return from Aston Villa once his season-long loan deal is cancelled but is not viewed as a long-term solution while Joel Matip, the Schalke defender who is out of contract in the summer, has yet to decide on his future.

Is anointing Ryan Giggs United’s way of closing door on José Mourinho?
~~AUTHOR~~
Paul Wilson
~CONTENTS~
José Mourinho has been available for three weeks now, and still no takers. Clearly three weeks is not exactly a lifetime in exile for a football manager but when Chelsea wielded the axe last month it was widely assumed leading clubs would be falling over themselves in the rush to secure his services, especially as he made sure to advertise himself as ready to start right away.Instead Mourinho has become a sort of stalking horse, the lurking possibility that forces clubs to act quickly and reveal their intentions. Rafael Benítez might have lasted a little longer but for the speculation linking Mourinho with a return to the Bernabéu, and to make sure that story did not go any further Real Madrid lost no time in naming Zinedine Zidane as an instant replacement.Zinedine Zidane tops popularity charts at Real Madrid | Sid Lowe Read moreManchester United appear to have been thinking along the same lines. Mourinho’s availability was the last thing Louis van Gaal needed as he was going through a bad patch in December, and though United have still to convince most observers they are back to anything like their best the club seized on the first signs of improvement to let it be known the present manager still has their full confidence. Not only that, they would like him to be succeeded by Ryan Giggs, when the time comes. Whether that is a wise and well thought out policy is a matter for another day, just as with Zidane’s somewhat hurried elevation at Madrid. The point is simply to close the door on Mourinho in as polite a way as possible. Thanks but no thanks. We’ve got what we need for now.In managerial terms, however, there is no further similarity between United and Madrid. The latter have had 14 managers since the turn of the century. It would not be the greatest surprise if Zidane did not prove a long-term success, because short-termism is the norm at Madrid. Whereas the English club are only on their third manager in 30 years, or their fourth if anyone insists on counting Giggs’s brief period as caretaker. United’s faith in long-term solutions is one of the reasons they are extending Van Gaal credit he barely deserves, and the thinking behind Giggs being identified as the candidate to replace him is that if all goes well he could stick around almost as long as a manager as he did as a player.That is the theory, anyway. You only have to look at the Sir Alex Ferguson years to see why United may want longevity and continuity, though the idea it can be achieved simply by staying in-house or close to home – as in identifying David Moyes as the nearest thing to a clone of a younger Ferguson – is less straightforward and so far unproven. Yet even though they are not fully recovered from botching the last succession United appear to be prepared to take the same risks all over again, if Giggs really is the new chosen one.To begin with the most obvious of several drawbacks, Giggs has no managerial pedigree. Less than three years ago United thought Premier League experience was more important than European achievement, hence the appointment of Moyes, who might have been the wrong man but at least had 11 solid years at Everton behind him. Now they want to give the job to a novice, which seems odd. Even Zidane had a year in charge of Castilla, which may be Madrid’s B team but is still better than nothing. Logically speaking, Mark Hughes, Steve Bruce or even Roy Keane deserve a chance before Giggs. Heck, even Gary Neville has now picked up more relevant experience. While it may be argued some of those managerial careers have not been illustrious enough to deserve a crack at United, Giggs has yet to commence a managerial career.Second, most of the time Giggs has been sitting beside Van Gaal picking up hints and broadening his experience, United have been patchy at best. By his own admission Van Gaal has been struggling to get performances out of his players, some of United’s recent displays have been the most uninspired for decades, so why appoint from within when most fans appear to be calling for a complete overhaul? What sort of continuity would United favour? More of the same?The future as envisaged by Ed Woodward seems to involve Van Gaal finally leading the side to some sort of success, a domestic title, for instance, or genuine improvement in the Champions League, before handing over to his replacement having restored some of the club’s old glory. If this happens, fair enough. If it does not, and there are few signs of any such turnaround yet, why would Van Gaal’s assistant be in line for promotion?It is beyond dispute Giggs was both a great player and a great Manchester United servant, but so was Bobby Charlton. So was Bryan Robson. There is no guarantee management will come as easily, and for every Pep Guardiola there are plenty who fail. United may view an internal appointment as a safe option but in reality there is no such thing. What happens if Van Gaal has become an unpopular figure by the time he departs? Would Giggs be tainted by association? Perhaps he already is, because at the moment Van Gaal is hardly universally admired.The bottom line is Woodward and his board cannot guess the future better than anyone else and United are simply not in a position to know when their next manager will be needed or what sort of a job he will be asked to do. United have two (should they beat Sheffield United on Saturday) FA Cup ties this month with Premier League games away at Newcastle and Liverpool, and Southampton at home between them.Pep Guardiola: ‘I need a new challenge, and I want to be a manager in England’ Read moreCome February they could be back in crisis mode, with Van Gaal hinting at resigning then denying it all over again. Is this really a time to be indicating the next manager will come from within, or does the club have an ulterior motive in promoting the Giggs ascendancy? It has already put a stop to the Mourinho gossip, but perhaps Woodward feels a Welshman in charge at Old Trafford would increase the club’s chances of landing Gareth Bale at some point.That would at least be clever, though plenty feel United would be better advised to stop tilting at Spanish windmills and sort out the misfiring in Manchester. More devious still is the possibility United may be using Giggs, or at least a settled succession, as a smokescreen to cover talks to divert Guardiola from his assumed path to Manchester City and smuggle him into Old Trafford while no one is looking.Unlikely, perhaps, but no more so than United opting for a manager with zero experience, or continuing to back a 64-year-old who has spent £250m yet confessed a few weeks ago his team did not dare play football.These are strange times indeed. Something does not add up and basically it is the fact United appear to favour fixing an unconventional situation with an unconventional solution. That seems fraught with danger but maybe Woodward knows what he is doing. He has seen most of United’s games this season, after all. Maybe he thinks it is high time they began to live a little dangerously.

Torino work with their fans to resurrect their old home and honour their greats
~CONTENTS~
Walking down Via Filadelfia, in the Lingotto district of Turin, eventually leads to the Stadio Olimpico, home of Torino FC. Along the way is a building site in a residential area, which on first glance could be mistaken for any ordinary urban regeneration project. It is only on closer inspection that you can see some eerie looking parts of an old concrete football stand. The graffiti scribbled along one wall that reads “Vecchio Cuore Granata” provides a hint of the building site’s significance.After being closed in 1963 and all but demolished in 1998, the Stadio Filadelfia is being redeveloped after numerous failed attempts. This is no ordinary undertaking, as the crumbling old ground is, as the poignant street art says, home to the old heart of this once dominant club. To this day it still carries a unique history that is deeply embedded in the soul of anyone who ever cheered for Torino.To understand the emotion surrounding this current undertaking, one must travel up the well maintained tramline to the site of the plane crash that killed the entire Grande Torino team on 4 May 1949. The steep, 20-minute journey on a railway that has been in operation since 1884 provides a perfect opportunity to reflect on the sheer altitude of the crash site, some 425 metres above sea level.On arrival at the summit, the location of the crash is not visible, with the imposing structure of the 300-year-old Basilica di Superga dominating the landscape. The atmosphere is always serene and quiet, the sun often shining brightly over the fog that envelops the city below. There is no hint of a tribute, other than a sign pointing to a memorial commemorating the “Caduti di Superga.”Torino: Serie A alternative club guide Read moreCaduti is a word used by Italians to describe those lost in battle, but here “the fallen” are the players and club officials, journalists and flight crew of a crash that left no survivors. Around the back of the church, there is no brash, tourist centred memorial but instead a subtle and understated reminder of a tragedy which has not only had an immeasurable impact on Torino FC but the wider world of football ever since.Mounted to the wall is a picture of the team in their Granata shirts, and a memorial stone which mentions all of the deceased by name. Under the heading I Campioni d’ Italia, the player’s names are carved into the stone, made equal by an alphabetical list. The only stand out name is Valentino Mazzola, who has (cap.) next to his name.A symbol of the team who found unparalleled success, Mazzola often inspired his teammates to victory single-handedly. Mario Rigamonti, who also perished at Superga, once said “Valentino alone is half the squad, and the other half is made up of the rest of us together.” Mazzola’s importance is recognised on a bull shaped plaque which lists every Torino captain that has followed in his footsteps, right up to current skipper Kamil Glik.In keeping with what is now a club tradition, the Poland international takes his turn to lead the current team on their annual pilgrimage up the hill to Superga on 4 May, taking a captain’s wreath in an act of remembrance.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   The Basilica of Superga, where the Grande Torino team crashed in 1949. Photograph: Chloe BeresfordIl Grande Torino began an unbeaten streak at the Stadio Filadelfia on 17 January 1943 that was only halted by their tragic deaths more than six years later. This incredible winning run at home spanned 100 games. In the five seasons from 1942-43 to 1948-49, the team scored 440 goals and only lost 17 of their 170 league matches.These formidable players had so dominated the Italian national team that on one famous occasion in a friendly against Hungary, all 10 outfield players belonged to Torino. After seeing many of their best players wiped out at Superga, the Azzurri struggled to recover and were unable to emerge from the group stages of the next five tournaments, before eventually finishing as runners up in the 1970 World Cup.It is no surprise that Torino, who lost all of their players barring three who had not been on the aircraft, suffered greatly after the disaster. Having been invincible over the course of those six years, a steady decline after the crash led to eventual relegation to Serie B in 1959.Legacy of the Grande Torino puts Serie A league position in perspective, writes Paolo Bandini Read moreIt was during the same year that Torino president Ferruccio Novo – having placed the stadium in the hands of the Italian football association – gave the go ahead for the Filadelfia to become a public space and potentially be demolished. The team temporarily moved to the Stadio Communale, but after relegation they moved back to the Filadelfia, until the last match was played there in 1963, after which they made the switch to what is now the Olimpico.Intrinsically linked to the success and ultimate demise of Il Grande Torino, there has been a longstanding desire among the Toro fans to see their former home rebuilt. In its current dilapidated state, it only serves as a reminder of the desolation caused by Superga, and many attempts have been made to revive it in the past.In 2011, a new idea was formed to resurrect the old stadium, located at No36 via Filadelfia. Income streams for the project have included pulling in money from the local council, Torino FC and various fan groups, while financial assistance is now being sought through crowdfunding.After so many false dawns, a group of 10,000 fans turned out for the laying of the foundation stone for the new structure last autumn. It is hoped that the construction will take exactly a year to complete. The date carries major significance, with ground broken on 17 October, meaning the stadium is set to reopen exactly 90 years after the Filadelfia hosted its first match.The first team will continue to play at the Olimpico, but the new facility will serve as a modern training centre. The home of the greatest Torino team in history will also be used to provide for the club’s future, with youth team fixtures set to be played in the 4,200-seat stadium.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Torino supporters welcome Juventus to the Stadio Olimpico for the Turin derby in April 2015. Photograph: Andrea Di Marco/APThe plans also provide room for a museum to immortalise those players lost in the tragedy, but perhaps the most poignant gesture of all will be found in two of the four corners of the stadium. Past will meet present as the old concrete corners of the stand will remain and become part of the new design.The remaining original aspects of the site currently create a similar atmosphere to that at Superga, providing an opportunity for quiet contemplation of the magnitude of what happened back in 1949. It is clear that this date is never far from the hearts and minds of Torino fans, as a short walk down to the Stadio Olimpico leads to the area outside the stadium which is appropriately named Piazzale Grande Torino.Superga will always remain a place to mourn the loss of that wonderful team, but the new stadium – complete with remnants of the old stands – will finally give fans a place to celebrate their greatness.

Liverpool ask to cancel Tiago Ilori’s season-long loan at Aston Villa

Liverpool have responded to their mounting injury problems in central defence by asking Aston Villa to cancel Tiago Ilori’s season-long loan at Villa Park.Liverpool running more under Jürgen Klopp than with Brendan Rodgers Read moreIlori, the London-born Portugal Under-21 international, has not played a competitive game for Liverpool since signing for £7m from Sporting Lisbon in 2013. The 22-year-old is yet to feature for Villa either this season, despite their struggle at the bottom of the Premier League, but such is the shortage of fit centre-halves available to Jürgen Klopp that his parent club are exploring the possibility of an Anfield return.Liverpool were without the injured Martin Skrtel and Mamadou Sakho for Tuesday’s impressive Capital One Cup semi-final at Stoke City and ended the first leg with midfielder Lucas Leiva alongside Kolo Touré in central defence after Dejan Lovren suffered a hamstring strain.Philippe Coutinho also damaged his hamstring in the 1-0 win – the extent of his and Lovren’s injuries have not been confirmed – and Touré finished his first full game in almost a month struggling with cramp.Klopp’s side are in the midst of a demanding run of games with Friday’s FA Cup third-round tie at Exeter City followed by home league games against Arsenal and Manchester United.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest  Klopp looks to transfer market after Liverpool beat Stoke City.Ilori would represent a stop-gap option should Villa agree to cancel his loan. The former Villa manager Tim Sherwood agreed a £1m fee to sign Ilori on loan with a view to a permanent transfer this summer, expected to be around £6m, but his failure to break into Rémi Garde’s team may encourage the Midlands club to sever ties.Schalke’s Joël Matip is another centre-half of interest to Liverpool, and eligible to sign a pre-contract agreement given the Cameroon international’s deal expires at the end of this season, but the German club have been reluctant so far to consider the possibility of a permanent January exit. Neven Subotic is another central defender under consideration. Klopp knows the Serbian well from their time together at Borussia Dortmund but his former club want a substantial fee for a temporary loan deal.

Liverpool running more under Jürgen Klopp than with Brendan Rodgers

Jürgen Klopp has reacted tetchily to suggestions that his training regime may be to blame for Liverpool’s succession of injuries but it could be down to the extra work being put into matches by his players.Liverpool ask to cancel Tiago Ilori’s season-long loan at Aston Villa Read moreThe latest stats from Opta suggest that the team are running on average six kilometres more during a game under Klopp than under his predecessor Brendan Rodgers.Liverpool are also doing many more sprints per game, on average 548 compared to 474 under Rodgers, the extra workload coming possibly as a consequence of Klopp’s adherence to gegenpressing, which involves forcing turnover of possession high up the pitch by relentless pressure from all 10 outfield players.Six of his squad – Dejan Lovren, Philippe Coutinho, Divock Origi, Martin Skrtel, Jordan Rossiter and Daniel Sturridge – have hamstring injuries, which can result from extra running and sprinting. According to sportsinjuryclinic.net: “Acute or sudden hamstring strains usually happen in two ways, either sprinting-related or stretch related.“During sprinting the hamstring muscles work extremely hard to decelerate the shin bone just before the foot strikes the ground and it is at this point that the hamstring is most likely to tear.”Liverpool’s latest casualties are Coutinho and Lovren, who were replaced during the 1-0 win at Stoke in the first leg of the Capital One Cup semi-final on Tuesday. That makes a total of 10 players out of action through injury, and Klopp is now threatening to enter the transfer market to compensate for the absence of centre-halves in particular.Liverpool ended the Stoke game with Lucas Leiva forming a makeshift central defence with Kolo Touré and Klopp had a further scare when the Ivorian also appeared to suffer a hamstring problem, though he later told the manager he thought it was just cramp.The former Liverpool midfielder Gaeme Souness was critical of Klopp’s approach. “A new manager comes in and all the chat was about high press further up the field. It’s hard work to do that for 90 minutes. You can do it in bursts.“You can do it for an hour, you can do it for 70 minutes, but to do it for 90 minutes is a big demand on your legs,” he said. “I just think they’ve fallen foul of that.”Opta’s stats, provided by EA Sports, show the team is running an average of 113.4km (68 miles) per game against the 107.8km under Rodgers, a workload that is unlikely to decrease in the near future. Liverpool play Exeter away in the FA Cup on Friday, then meet Arsenal and Manchester United, followed by Norwich and the second leg of their semi-final against Stoke, all before the end of January.Klopp was unable to shed light on the cause of the injuries after the Stoke game. Asked whether it might be his training system that could be to blame, the manager appeared to bridle, saying: “We don’t train, we only recover so that’s the situation now.”But he did add: “I am responsible for these things, and if you want to make me responsible for our hamstrings – that’s the next step, I know this. I know this.”He received some support from the midfielder Adam Lallana who said: “It’s just a physical game. Look at the amount of games we’ve had over the Christmas period. It’s been a tough run and with the demands on players nowadays there’s bound to be injuries. If you look at teams around the league I bet you’ll find the number of injuries has definitely increased.”Liverpool’s walking woundedPhilippe Coutinho HamstringDejan Lovren HamstringDivock Origi HamstringDaniel Sturridge HamstringMartin Skrtel HamstringJordan Rossiter HamstringMamadou Sakho KneeJordan Henderson FootJoe Gomez KneeDanny Ings Knee

The Question: what is attacking football?
~~AUTHOR~~
Jonathan Wilson
~CONTENTS~
After Manchester United’s goalless draw with West Ham in December, Louis van Gaal professed himself baffled by the Old Trafford crowd’s demands for his side to be more attacking. “I don’t understand that they are shouting ‘attack, attack’ because we are the attacking team and not West Ham United,” he said. In doing so, he raised a question that seems fundamental to football and yet is surprisingly hard to answer: what is attacking?Louis van Gaal: entertaining the media, if not Manchester United’s fans | Barry Glendenning Read more“We,” Van Gaal went on, “are always more dominating than our opponents. When we have a lot of ball possession, you have a lot of ball possession to create chances and not to play the ball around and don’t score.” So for Van Gaal, having the ball is attacking; he believes goals will come from possession. “My opinion about scoring goals is not only compulsion but also a lot of luck,” he said.The aspect of luck is clearly important. There are games in which one team plays superbly, have 20 chances and fail to score, maybe because of a striker who is out of sorts, or thwarted by a goalkeeper in inspired form, defenders popping up on the line, the ball hitting the post and bouncing out not in. That happens. Goals alone aren’t a measure of how attacking a side is (although clearly there is a correlation, particularly over longer periods of time).United against West Ham had 21 chances, but no one – Van Gaal perhaps excepted – could realistically claim they had played great attacking football. Only one of the chances resulted in a shot on target, which at the very least suggests United weren’t attacking efficiently. It’s telling that eight of their shots came from outside the box (and three more right on the edge), and that eight were the result of set plays. Their way of attacking wasn’t creating good chances. The problems have continued since then – just four goals in the following five league games, even if those matches yielded 21 shots on target between them.But even to talk of a number or quality of chances seems the wrong way round. That’s the result of attacking, not the cause of it. So while we may know what attacking looks like – goals, shots, chances, crosses, etc – is there any way of categorising the approach that may lead to that?Proactive v reactive      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Germany counterattacked brilliantly at the 2010 World Cup but some fans objected to the tactics being described as reactive. Photograph: Christophe Simon/AFP/Getty ImagesPerhaps most simply, football can be divided into proactive and reactive approaches – playing with the ball, looking to control possession against playing without the ball, looking to play on the counter. Yet even that is more complicated than it may at first appear.During the 2010 World Cup I wrote a piece in which I pointed out that Germany were a reactive side who counterattacked brilliantly. That prompted unusual fury below the line; one commenter accused me of being a Russian plant. Reactive, it seemed, was perceived as an insult, counterattacking seen as pejorative.That, surely, has now changed. Jürgen Klopp’s Borussia Dortmund showed how stirring counterattacking can be, while many came to find the relentless possession football of Spain wearisome. But that’s where the association of proactive/reactive with possession/non-possession starts to fall down. For one thing, Van Gaal’s United had 58% possession against West Ham, yet fans clearly didn’t think that was attacking.And for another, pressing – the organised hounding of the opponent in possession – is about as far from being reactive as it’s possible to get. You can counterattack by sitting deep and waiting for the ball to come to you, or you can counterattack by chasing the ball high up the pitch. Counterattacking, it turns out, can be reactive or proactive.Not only that, but Van Gaal’s sides (and this is not only true of United) often manage to be reactive with the ball, their risk-averse probing being as reliant on the opposition making a mistake as José Mourinho at his most possession-averse.The ball      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Without the ball Real Madrid’s expensive attacking talents cannot hurt sides, as Barcelona showed in winning 4-0 in November. Photograph: Daniel Ochoa de Olza/APShortly before the 2014 World Cup, I was on the panel at a Blizzard Q&A where an audience member insisted that what he wanted from England wasn’t necessarily to win but just to be attacking. I asked him what he meant and he talked about getting more exciting attacking players in the team. Which I suppose is reasonable enough. But the problem is, before those exciting players can do any attacking, they have to have the ball – a lesson Florentino Pérez, for instance, seems never quite to learn.The issue of how to get the ball comes back to the issue of proactivity and reactivity. If your players are good enough, you can have it and keep it, like a Van Gaal side, and assume that the attritional process of passing will wear an opponent down. You can sit deep, rely on your defenders or your defensive shape being good enough to win possession and then counter, with the advantage that an opponent on the attack is likely to be off-balance and to have left space that can be exploited. Or you can press, go hunting possession, again with the advantage that a quick transition is likely to be more productive than attacking a defence that is set.Most commonly, of course, teams do all three, but in varying proportions. In the Premier League this year, it’s notable how much more common the latter two are than the former, something that probably in part goes towards explaining why home advantage is apparently so much less significant than it was. Counterattacking has become more common than attacking – although even there is a complication in that a recognition of the value of counterattacking means that the counter-counter – of which gegenpressing is the most proactive and celebrated example – has also grown in popularity with the result that the number of goals scored on the counterattack as actually fallen over the past decade.Risk       Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Manchester United attempted 81 crosses during a Premier League match against Fulham in February 2014 but still failed to win the game. Photograph: Andrew Yates/AFP/Getty ImagesYou can play breathtakingly exciting football with 40% of the ball and desperately dull football with 60%. You can be boring with 20 chances and thrilling with five. More than outcomes, perhaps, what is important is mood. This is Sjaak Swart’s point. “I never gave the ball back to my defence, never!” the Ajax winger of the 70s told David Winner in Brilliant Orange, complaining about how Ajax’s wingers in the 1990s, Marc Overmars and Finidi George, would check back if faced with two opponents. “It’s unbelievable! But that was the system with Van Gaal. Many games you are sleeping! On television, they say: ‘Ajax 70% ball possession.’ So what? It’s not football. The creativity is gone.”He wanted the wingers to take on the defenders, to risk losing the ball. United fans now who speak of the classic United style – and clubs’ styles are always hard to pin down – seem to mean a game based on width and getting crosses into the box. But crosses also risk losing the ball. The joy of Klopp’s Dortmund at its best is how quickly the team got the ball forward, even though that risked losing possession.Yet take each of those three points in turn and it’s evident that none in itself is a panacea. Dribble too much and you end up with a mannered, individualistic game not unlike football in the 1860s and 1870s before the Scots invented passing. Cross too much and you end up like David Moyes’s United against Fulham in February 2014, attempting 81 crosses without anything to show for it. Get it forward too quickly too often and you end up with the brainless long-ball nonsense that has blighted English football for so long; there’s a backlash in Argentina, for instance, against Marcelo Bielsa partly because so many teams in the Primera now play too quickly and too directly, conforming to Bielsa’s vertical tenets without the tactical organisation to make it effective.Balance, clearly, is part of it, but there must also be intelligence: endlessly repeating the same trick may have attacking intent, but the effect is tedium. There must be some kind of risk, but equally there needs to be a platform to support the risk-takers. Short passes can be attacking, but so can long. Playing with the ball can be attacking, but so can playing without. Proactive football can be attacking, but so can reactive. Dribbling can be attacking, but so can an approach based almost entirely on passing.Attacking is, like so much in football, nebulous, and is largely dependent on context. In the end, attacking becomes like pornography in Justice Potter Stewart’s famous description: it’s hard to define, but you know it when you see it.

Leeds United charge fans £42 for Championship game against Bristol City
~~AUTHOR~~
Guardian sport
~CONTENTS~
Leeds United have been criticised after it was revealed supporters will have to pay £42 for a ticket to watch their Championship fixture against Bristol City at Elland Road on 23 January.Leeds, who “reluctantly” agreed to allow last month’s game against Derby County to be broadcast live on Sky after initially denying cameras entry to the ground, have ruled that the fixture against City to be a category A despite their opponents only being promoted from League One last season. That means that fans can buy a ticket in advance for £37 but that cost rises to £42 for tickets bought on the door.The decision has been criticised in an article on fansnetwork.co.uk, in which an anonymous supporter reveals that the ticket will cost more than twice as much as he paid to watch the 1-1 draw against Barcelona in the Champions League in 2000.Time for TV companies to be more considerate to common football fan | Daniel Taylor Read moreThe article states: “In that Champions League season the Whites repaid the loyalty of their long-suffering fans by offering a package deal where for just £60 on the Kop we got to see the mighty Catalans, Beskitas and AC Milan to boot! What good value that was given our dramatic progression out of the first group stage when everyone, myself included, had written us off.“I know times have changed but I can’t help but think Massimo [Cellino], or whoever makes these odd decisions has got it wrong charging this much to watch us take on Bristol City. It also strikes a hammer blow against the very valid argument that Sky rescheduling is killing our attendances, charging ridiculous prices for average, second-tier football might just be a contributory factor as to why attendances are plummeting this season.”The article goes on to state that this will be the seventh time this season that Leeds have charged category A prices, including for the 1-0 win over Preston North End on 20 December.

Which clubs have had the most promotions and relegations?
~~AUTHOR~~
John Ashdown
~CONTENTS~
“Which clubs have experienced the most ups and downs in their histories?” wrote Jim Hearson a few weeks ago. “On the flip side, who are the most stable/boring clubs?”An excellent question. Handily, Pete Waterhouse has been keeping tabs. “I (don’t ask why) keep a spreadsheet for this sort of thing and can handily cut and paste the top 10 for the English leagues,” writes Pete, who lists the big movers as:1 Grimsby Town, Notts County 303 Birmingham City 294 Doncaster Rovers 275 Bolton Wanderers, Leicester City 267 Cardiff City 25 2014 - Related to Championship8 Port Vale, Sheffield Wednesday, Preston North End 2411 Lincoln City, Bristol City 23“As this was compiled somewhat manually, there may be inaccuracies (it includes election/promotion to the league (or founding it!) as a movement, and all the teams moved to division four when it was created),” adds Pete.“As for the most stable club ... well I don’t have a ready made table of those but looking through my list of ups and downs particularly low ones seem to be : Arsenal 4 (two promotions, one relegation and entrance to the league) with no movement since 1919 (and that one was somewhat controversial), Everton 5 (two promotions, two relegations, founding members), with no movement since 1955, and Rochdale 7 (three promotions, three relegations and entrance to the league), who famously spent 36 seasons in a row in the fourth tier, but are now ruining it as three of those seven movements have been since 2010.”Further down the league ladder, some non-league sides have enjoyed a serene recent history. “The Ryman League Premier Division can be proud that it has two mainstays who have somehow contrived not to be promoted, relegated, nor forcibly moved for decades,” writes Darren Beach. “Hendon are in their 43rd consecutive season there since 1962-63, while Harrow Borough have been there since 1978-79 – 27 seasons and counting.“Both have finished in the dropzone but were reprieved due to troubles faced by other clubs who’d finished higher, while Harrow Borough actually won the Ryman League in 1983-84 by 17 points, but turned down promotion to what is now the National League due to the financial risks involved.”I’M SPARTAK! NO, I’M SPARTAK“Though born in Ireland, an immigrant to the United States and pressganged into the British navy, William Brown went on to become an Argentine national hero due to his involvement in their independence movement and his position as the first admiral of the Argentine navy,” wrote Tim Dockery. “Four professional Argentine soccer clubs have been named in his honor: Club Almirante Brown, Club Atlético Almirante Brown, Club Atlético Brown and Club Social y Atlético Guillermo Brown. Is there anyone who has had more than four professional soccer clubs named after him or her?”“Many football clubs in Eastern Europe (and also in some other parts of the world) are called Spartak – named after Spartacus, the gladiator who organised a famous uprising of slaves in Ancient Rome in the first century BC,” writes Edmond Nersezov. “Spartak Varna, Spartak Plovdiv, Spartak Moscow, Spartak Trnava and so on.”And elsewhere in mythology: “The answer must surely be Ajax son of Telemon, after whom Ajax FC of the Netherlands is named, and (whether by extension or independently) at least 10 other football clubs throughout the world,” writes Sam Blanning.Which clubs are named after people? | The Knowledge Read moreIn terms of real actual people who have existed, Bea Watkinson notes that another explorer outstrips William Brown. “Vasco Da Gama the Portuguese explorer comes to mind instantly as a man with five football teams named after him,” writes Bea. “The most famous is CR Vasco da Gama in Brazil, the 1998 Copa Libertadores champions. But there is also Clube Deśpórtivé Vasco da Gama based in the city of Vasco da Gama in Goa, India; the South African Club Vasco da Gama in Cape Town. As well as Associação Desportiva Vasco da Gama and Vasco Esporte Clube who both play in regional leagues in Brazil. I suppose it pays to be an explorer if you are to get anything named after you.”THE TREVOR BENJAMINS OF THE DUGOUT“I was looking through Ronald Koeman’s Wikipedia page and realised he had managed and played for three of the same teams (Feyenoord, PSV and Ajax),” begins Tom Clarke. “Upon further investigation, I can only think of Glenn Hoddle and Terry Venables who have managed four of the same teams they played for (including the England national team). My question is, are there any Trevor Benjamin-styled journeyman footballers who subsequently became journeyman managers, managing the same sides they played for, beating Hoddle’s and El Tel’s efforts?”“How about Sam Allardyce?” suggests Rob Fielding. “He has played for and managed Limerick, Bolton, Preston and Sunderland.” A fair shout, although Allardyce was player-manager at Limerick and caretaker manager at Preston.Sean DeLoughry notes that: “Local legend Dermot Keely played for and managed Home Farm, Dundalk, UCD, Shamrock Rovers and Sligo Rovers” in the League of Ireland.THE OLDEST KEEPERS IN TOWN“In a recent A-League match that saw Melbourne City beat Perth Glory 5-1, I realised that the goalkeepers, Thomas Sorensen (39) and Ante Covic (40) respectively, had a combined age of 79,” writes Ciaran Hannigan-Purcell. “Is this the oldest pair of opposing goalkeepers in professional football’s history?”Covic and Sorensen are fresh-faced youngsters compared to a couple of goalkeeping duos suggested by Knowledge readers over the past few weeks. “On November 25 2007, Lazio beat Parma 1-0,” begins Boris Cule. “The respective goalkeepers were Marco Balotta, aged 43, and Luca Bucci, aged 38 , with a combined age of 81.”But even Balotta and Bucci are mere novices compared to this pair: “On 17 April 2010, Dagenham and Redbridge played host to Burton Albion in a League Two fixture,” writes Jerard Carne. “The respective goalkeepers that day were 41-year-old Tony Roberts, and 46-year-old Kevin Poole, their combined age of 87 dwarfing that of the Australian-based whippersnappers. Youth prevailed in this particular fixture, with the sprightlier Roberts helping his team to a 2-1 victory.”      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Kevin Poole in action for Derby in 2005.

Kirkcaldy’s Raith Rovers can justifiably claim to be pioneers of the Scottish game – they had enjoyed a successful trip to Copenhagen in the summer of 1922 and fancied repeating the trick at the end of the following season, but this time taking in the sunnier climbs of the Canary Islands. So in the summer of 1923 they boarded the Highland Loch, which was calling in at the Canaries en route to Buenos Aires with its cargo of passengers and, apparently, chilled meat.The Stark’s Park party had reached northern Spain and were off the coast of Galicia, negotiating Cape Finisterre, in violent weather when the ship ran aground. The players and other passengers were roused from their beds, lifeboats were manned and the group was towed to the village of Villagarcia by local fishermen.The following day a passing liner bound for the Canaries picked up the 20-strong Rovers squad and were, according to Rovers player Tom Jennings, invited to eat at the captain’s table because of their chivalrous behaviour during the rain-swept abandoning of the Highland Loch. A few days later they were safely deposited at their destination – and the traumatic journey did not seem to adversely effect the players. They won all four games on the tour, although history does not report another European adventure in 1924 …For thousands more questions and answers take a trip through the Knowledge archive.Can you help?“In a moment of Wikipedia-fuelled, post-Christmas procrastination,” begins Adam Glass, “I happened to notice that Iain Dowie had played consecutively for three clubs which have train stations on the same line - St Albans City, Hendon and then Luton Town (the line being the Thameslink from Bedford to Brighton). I was wondering whether any other ex/current players could match or better such an achievement of consecutive clubs on the same train line?”“What’s the longest run of players one can come up with whose first name and second name are linked?” tweets Chris Van Thomas. “Eg: Cameron-Jerome-Thomas.”“If Leicester City win the Premier League this season, would Peter and Kasper Schmeichel be the first father and son combo to both be the starting goalkeeper for a league title-winning team in the same country?” wonders Conway O’Neill.“Scottish Championship side Dumbarton have achieved what I believe may be a first,” writes Paul Philbin. “Their last three matches have all resulted in their opponents subsequently getting rid of their respective managers. Has this happened before?”“I am a Northampton Town fan and on Saturday 12 December the Cobblers went top of League Two,” cheers Lee Wade. “This was the first time we have topped any division for 25 years.

Football transfer rumours: Lionel Messi to join Manchester City?
~~AUTHOR~~
Barry Glendenning
~CONTENTS~
The Labour party reshuffle may be stealing the headlines, but Pep Guardiola’s imminent move to the Premier League is what most concerns the Rumour Mill this morning. Despite Manuel Pellegrini’s stance on the controversial Trident nuclear weapons system being unknown (almost total indifference is the Rumour Mill’s uninformed guess), the Chilean looks a certainty to be shown the door at the Etihad this summer to make way for the outgoing Bayern Munich manager. Should he pitch up on the blue side of Manchester, Pep will attempt to make Lionel Messi the latest name on a roll of goalscoring honour that already includes luminaries such as Shaun Goater, Eric Brook, Paul Dickov, Niall Quinn and Horace Barnes. No pressure, Leo.Eden Hazard’s time at Chelsea could be nearing an end, with the Star reporting that Real Madrid are prepared to stump up £100m to bring the out-of-sorts Belgian midfielder to the Bernabéu. Some manner of swap deal involving Gareth Bale could well be on the cards, although the Welsh winger is also being linked with a £75m move to Manchester United. Esteemed Guardian football scribes Sid Lowe and Stuart James reckon Bale remains content in the Spanish capital and say his future will hinge on whether or not the new Real manager Zinedine Zidane decides to deploy him as a wide man or in his preferred new role as a central midfielder.Pep Guardiola: ‘I need a new challenge, and I want to be a manager in England’ Read moreThe Watford Observer reports that the Spanish defensive midfielder Mario Suárez could be on his way to Vicarage Road, having failed to make much of an impact at Fiorentina after moving there from Atlético Madrid last summer. Liverpool are also keeping tabs on the 28-year-old, whose days at the Stadio Artemio Franchi look numbered. “Mario Suárez to Watford? I can’t talk about that now, there are many rumours around the player,” said his agent, Manuel García Quilón, to an old lady who’d actually asked him for directions to the souvenir shop at the Palazzo Pitti.The FC Basel midfielder Mohamed Elneny’s move to Arsenal looks likely to be signed and sealed “in the coming days” according to the Swiss club, while their rivals Grasshopper Zurich are rubbing their powerful hind legs with excitement at the prospect of receiving a big bag of cash for the midfielder Shani Tarashaj from Everton. Tarashaj is understood to have coughed for the Everton doctors and agreed personal terms on a four-and-a-half year deal with Goodison Park suits, but will be loaned back to his current club for the rest of the season just as soon as he’s inked a contract with the Toffees.Crystal Palace, Aston Villa and Newcastle are all interested in taking Loïc Rémy off Chelsea’s hands, but it seems the striker is not for sale. It is, however, believed he could return to his goal-shy former club Newcastle on loan until the end of the season in a state of affairs the Magpies manager Steve McClaren was not prepared to shed any light on. “Everybody can see what we are and what we need going forward,” he said. “That’s something that will be discussed privately.” Considerably less coy French sports daily L’Equipe says that Newcastle have already bid €25m for the Lyon striker Alexandre Lacazette in the hope of securing somebody to score the goals required to keep them in the Premier League.The new Fulham manager Slavisa Jokanovic’s announcement that the club’s Moussa Dembélé is not for sale has done little to halt speculation that the 19-year-old could be off to Manchester United or Crystal Palace. Meanwhile in Leicester, local paper the Mercury says that reports of Claudio Ranieri’s interest in the Milan midfielder Nigel de Jong have been greatly exaggerated. “No inquiries have been made,” it reports. The former Manchester City man has also been linked with a move to Watford, in talk featuring rumours of Étienne Capoue going the other way.The pink Italian paper Gazzetta dello Sport says Manchester United are ready to splurge the thick end of £37m on Lazio’s Brazilian midfielder Felipe Anderson, while Crystal Palace want to add to their collection of strikers and will offer Fiorentina £10m for Khouma Babacar, who is also inching his way across the radar at Southampton and Leicester. With Giuseppe Rossi also likely to leave La Viola on loan in January, with Liverpool a possible destination, the Serie A side may try to lure Graziano Pellè to Florence from Southampton. Firmly of the belief that there ain’t no Partey like an Atlético Madrid Partey, Saints are believed to be interested in bringing the Spanish side’s midfielder Thomas Partey to St Mary’s.Anyone want a loan of Republic of Ireland internationals Aiden McGeady and Darron Gibson? You can have ’em, say Everton. Meanwhile at Championship-bound Aston Villa, twinkle-toed midfielder Jack Grealish is also believed to be available on loan. And finally, the Porto striker Vincent Aboubakar may be drafted in to the King Power Stadium to bolster Leicester’s fairytale tilt at the league title. The end.

A-League transfer window sees signings for Melbourne City and Victory
~CONTENTS~
Melbourne City have completed the signing of Western Sydney Wanderers goalkeeper Dean Bouzanis to replace outgoing gloveman Tando Velaphi.Velaphi is expected to sign for a J-League club within days, with Bouzanis taking the vacant position as back-up to established No1 Thomas Sorensen.Melbourne City lock in four rising stars with long-term deals Read moreWanderers – City’s opponent on Saturday night – have given their first-choice goalkeeper role to former City custodian Andrew Redmayne, who was released by John van ‘t Schip in the off-season.Sorensen’s emergence left little room for Velaphi, 28, who finished last season as City’s first-choice goalkeeper but was relegated to the bench by the Dane for the new campaign.He will remain at the club this week and be farewelled at Saturday match at AAMI Park.City coach John van ‘t Schip said the fan-favourite would be missed.“Tando has been a model professional and has developed into a mature and talented goalkeeper,” van’ t Schip said.“Tando was a popular figure not only in the change rooms but with the fans and I’m sure they will join with me in wishing Tando all the best for the next challenge in his career.”Former Liverpool reserves goalkeeper Bouzanis, 25, has signed until the end of the season.The movement means both clubs have entirely new goalkeeper ranks from last season.City’s Melbourne rivals, Victory, have signed winger Jai Ingham from FFA Cup semi-finalists Hume City in time for the match.Striker Besart Berisha hopes his availability, along with the return to fitness of Archie Thompson (knee) and Gui Finkler (calf), gives Victory the firepower to beat Central Coast Mariners in Geelong on Friday.“Archie is fantastic ... he is cool in the game, he knows when to play the ball, he knows when there is danger,” he said.“GUI is our maestro in the midfield. Jai is very quick and very technical and a strong player, a quick player. I’m happy now that the goals are coming and the points are coming and I really hope now we start a better run.”Melbourne Victory break Hunter Stadium A-League hoodoo in Jets win Read moreThompson made his first start of the campaign in Victory’s drought-breaking 1-0 win at Newcastle on Sunday and was a stand-out in training on Wednesday morning.Finkler has missed the past two games with a calf complaint but also trained fully and should resume in the No10 role against the Mariners.In Victory’s favour too is Central Coast’s goalkeeping stocks, with coach Tony Walmsley to choose from 18-year-old Tom Hewerd-Belle and newly signed Alastair Bray, 22.Both are untested at A-League level but Berisha said his previous encounters with young keepers had not yielded huge hauls.“From experience I always find out that they make the best game of their life,” he joked.Victory are hoping they attract a crowd close to 20,000 for Friday night’s match.

Video trials to assist referees may take place in next season’s FA Cup
~~AUTHOR~~
Owen Gibson
~CONTENTS~
Video replays for referees could be given a trial in the FA Cup from next season after the game’s law-making body decided to recommend large-scale live experiments.Proposals to introduce video assistance for referees has gained rapid traction since the then Fifa president Sepp Blatter performed a U-turn and endorsed the idea in 2014, two years after the introduction of goalline technology.The English Football Association has been a big supporter of the idea and following a meeting of the International FA Boards in London, the chief executive, Martin Glenn, said trials could begin as soon as next season if the idea was rubber-stamped at the Ifab AGM in March.A brief guide to … the FA Cup third round, where even the minnows have their day Read more“I’m very happy for things within my direct control – the English FA’s direct control – to be part of that,” said Glenn. “We are big supporters of the use of technology. So, what do we control? We control the FA Cup.”The Scottish FA will also hold talks about experimenting with the technology in next season’s Scottish Cup. If the live trials go ahead next season and are deemed successful, video assistance could be introduced worldwide in time for the 2018-19 season.In terms of the Scottish Cup, the Scottish FA chief executive, Stewart Regan, said: “It’s one that we would certainly discuss as a board. As a personal preference, it’s something I’d like to see push forward.”Big questions remain about the extent to which it might affect the flow of the game and the practicalities of ensuring that every ground was kitted out with cameras. The FA, however, is keen to be in the vanguard of testing the technology. The trials would be limited to decisions on goals, red cards, penalties and cases of mistaken identity.They would involve different kinds of experiments, such as video only being used when the referee asks for assistance or, alternatively, where the video assistant would be allowed to flag up errors.So-called “coach challenges” – which could result in each dugout being allowed to challenge a set number of decisions in every match – are not likely to be part of the first wave of trials.Video decisions would be time limited and, unlike rugby, contentious decisions would not be replayed on big screens for the crowd to see but information relayed to the referee via an earpiece.If introduced in the FA Cup, the idea would be to experiment in every match in which it was possible to do so – essentially those grounds equipped for television broadcasts. Ifab wants the tests to be as competition-wide as possible, ideally an entire season of a league or cup competition.Jonathan Ford, chief executive of the Football Association of Wales, said that use of the technology would be limited to “very important, game-changing moments”.He added: “The decision is to put a very strong recommendation to the AGM that this is accepted, that experimentation does happen.”Ford said that they remained a long way from finalising how any future video refereeing system could work.“The fluidity of the game is all important as is the ultimate authority of the referee,” he said. “Whatever system is finally adopted, assuming it eventually is, must reflect both of those principles.”In February, Ifab ruled that it would delay trials of video technology for at least 12 months. The Dutch FA was keen to give a trial to the concept in Cup matches but Fifa said the decision should be put off for the time being. There is believed to be a stronger chance that at its AGM in Cardiff in March Ifab will decide to press ahead with the trials.The board consists of four representatives – one from each of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland – and four from Fifa, each of which has equal voting rights.David Elleray, the former Premier League referee who sits on Ifab’s technical subcommittee, said: “The main objective is to try to eliminate clear errors by the referee. You will never eliminate all errors from the game but this is a major step forward in reducing those errors.”Ifab approved the use of goalline technology in 2012 and since then there have been an increasing number of calls from players and managers to use video technology in other aspects of the game.

New MLS club LAFC welcomes Will Ferrell as co-owner: 'This is not a joke'
~~AUTHOR~~
Guardian sport
~CONTENTS~
Los Angeles FC, the MLS expansion club expected to begin play in the 2018 season, unveiled its swanky new colors and crest in a glittering gala ceremony in LA on Thursday. Then Will Ferrell joined the party.About 25 minutes into the presentation, where the club’s new black-and-gold colors were laid out, Ferrell got up on stage, and plonked a chair between co-owner Peter Guber and LA mayor Eric Garcetti. Mia Hamm, the former US women’s national team star and another of the LAFC co-owners, asked the comedian: “You want in?”Ferrell answered that he did. Hamm responded: “It looks like you’re in.”“This is not a joke,” Ferrell said. “I’m actually a member of this fine ownership group.”Several dozen fans whooped and hollered.“I’ve never been a part-owner of anything,” Ferrell said before correcting himself. “I’m still part-owner of an ‘84 Toyota Camry with my brother.”ESPN FC (@ESPNFC)"This is not a joke." Will Ferrell announced as #LAFC co-owner. pic.twitter.com/IJKJ7sEWzFJanuary 7, 2016LAFC is already attracting plenty of attention more than two years before anybody officially kicks a ball. The club will join MLS for the 2018 season, but it already has an identity built around those colors and a logo featuring a wing incorporated into an art deco-inspired “LA” monogram.“Our promise is to unite the world’s city with the world’s game,” LAFC president Tom Penn said.LAFC managing partner Henry Nguyen said the colors and crest are a major part of the club’s aspiration to create an internationally known brand. While black has been part of LAFC’s identity from the start, the club’s shade of dark gold appears to be unique in the league, and LAFC also plans to incorporate red as an accent to its schemes and uniforms.LAFC (@LAFC)Our crest. #WeAreLAFC #BlacknGold pic.twitter.com/MPFO4rp4saJanuary 7, 2016“The wing is such a special symbol of what this city is, in terms of meaning, flight, dynamism,” Nguyen said. “This is the City of Angels. And it’s every type of wing. It’s an Aztec eagle wing. It’s a dragon wing. It’s an angel wing. It’s whatever wing you want it to be.”Garcetti, who envisions Los Angeles as “the sports capital of the world” while it competes for the 2024 Olympics, heralded the next step in the evolution of LAFC, which was formally granted MLS entry 15 months ago. The club is building Los Angeles’ first open-air stadium since 1962, playing a part in the Olympic bid and adding even more energy to the city’s revitalized downtown.“We’re not going to wait for any other league to make a decision, because football is here today,” Garcetti said, jokingly referring to the NFL’s protracted decision about returning to the nation’s second-largest media market.Rams owner Stan Kroenke rips 'lagging' St Louis market as he seeks move to LA Read morePenn said LAFC’s branding work began even before its stadium situation was finalized.“Once we solidified that we were in the heart of Los Angeles legitimately, with our brick and mortar, we wanted to build around the moniker of LA, because it’s globally recognized,” Penn said. “It’s very aspirational. What you learn when you talk to people overseas, LA is just an aspirational place to be.”While the branding is a major part of the LAFC endeavor, other aspects are also surging forward for the deep-pocketed ownership group that includes Magic Johnson, Nomar Garciaparra and Hamm, backed by Malaysian moguls Vincent Tan and Ruben Gnanalingam.Nguyen revealed the club expects to begin demolition of the Los Angeles Sports Arena shortly after getting full entitlements in May. LAFC will build its $250m stadium on the site next-door to the historic Coliseum.John Thorrington, LAFC’s newly hired executive vice president of soccer operations, also expects to make an announcement soon unveiling the club’s academy plans. The franchise will ramp up its technical preparations shortly after the first shovels hit the ground.Until then, LAFC will use its image and merchandise to keep Southern California in anticipation. The star power of its ownership group won’t hurt, either.Ferrell, a longtime soccer aficionado who starred in the not-quite-a-classic soccer comedy Kicking and Screaming, joined the ownership group because his children play soccer with another LAFC co-owner’s kids.Ferrell joked that he began playing soccer in the “mean streets of Irvine, California” when he was eight years old, and he said that his wife, Viveca, played soccer at Pomona College.“To say soccer is a part of our lives in an understatement,” he said.

Sam Allardyce ready to rebuild Sunderland around Jermain Defoe
~~AUTHOR~~
Louise Taylor
~CONTENTS~
Sam Allardyce has signalled his intention to rebuild Sunderland around Jermain Defoe by stating that it would take an incredible offer to tempt him to sell the former England striker.When Allardyce took over from Dick Advocaat at the Stadium of Light, he seemed unconvinced by Defoe, cautioning him that modern forwards have to do more than score goals. There was also a concern, earlier voiced by Advocaat and Gus Poyet, that the 33-year-old, signed from Toronto a year ago, was unsuited to the lone striker system favoured by assorted Sunderland managers.Sunderland complete signing of Jan Kirchhoff from Bayern Munich Read moreSince then, though, Defoe has forced his way off the bench and into the starting XI and scored twice during last Saturday’s 3-1 home win against Aston Villa. He has become so important to the club’s fight against relegation that Allardyce is prepared to alter his team’s style to accommodate a player who, until recently, had been widely expected to leave Wearside this month.“We haven’t had any bids for Jermain and I suppose if there had been a bid for him, I would have turned it down,” Allardyce said, with Defoe likely to be rested at Arsenal in the third round of the FA Cup on Saturday, when the manager will field a heavily rotated side. “Unless it had been that big a bid that the owner told me we couldn’t afford to turn it down. Every club has that scenario but we haven’t had a bid for Jermain and we don’t want to sell him.“There’s always been a belief that maybe he can’t play up front on his own but he’s played on his own a couple of times for me now and I’m more than willing to continue down that line.“If he can continue being as good, and as clinical as he was last weekend, then long may it last. It’s a change of style of play for us where we have to work to get Jermain on the end of the buildup. Normally, a general centre-forward playing on his own will hold up the ball up and be someone to break off from but, with Jermain, you have to adjust your style of play a little bit.”Allardyce also took the opportunity to apologise to Jürgen Klopp for his comments on the Liverpool manager’s injury problems. “If Jürgen is listening, I didn’t mean to upset you or criticise your club in any way,” he said. “I was just giving what I see could be one of the reasons why we get injuries. It was a question that Alan [Brazil on TalkSport] asked me, I answered it and never expected it to bring the headlines it’s brought.“I had no intentions of trying to wind him up or any such. He threw the question in at the end and maybe I should have said it’s not for me to answer, it’s for Jürgen.”   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest  Sam Allardyce ‘didn’t mean to upset’ Jürgen Klopp – videoAllardyce’s attempts to strengthen Sunderland at the opposite end of the pitch have received a boost with the new signing Jan Kirchhoff in a £750,000 transfer from Bayern Munich.The 25-year-old, 6ft 5in central defender has failed to win a place in Pep Guardiola’s side but the German is likely to see considerably more first-team action at Sunderland. Allardyce, meanwhile, confirmed his pursuit of Lorient’s Ivorian defender Lamine Koné had fallen through and that Kirchhoff’s arrival dictated he was no longer interested in Queens Park Rangers’ Steven Caulker.The collapse of the mooted £5m Koné deal has caused considerable consternation in France, where Alex Hayes, Lorient’s vice-president, is unhappy with the Premier League club’s conduct.“It’s quite outrageous on Sunderland’s part,” Hayes told the French newspaper Le Télégramme. Hayes added that Lorient were exploring the possibility of taking legal recourse: “They tried to change the pre-agreed deal and Lamine called me to ask if he could return to Lorient.”Allardyce seemed rather less exercised. “The Koné negotiations just broke down and it didn’t happen,” he said. “If we get Jan then missing out on Koné is not that big a blow. Transfers are never easy at this time of year; it’s never easy to do business in January.“Many things have to drop into place to make a signing but we’ve done a lot of negotiations, a lot of groundwork, in December and, thankfully, with Jan it looks as though we’ve got the first one in.“You find out very quickly if our position in the table, or geographically, is going to be a factor. You speak to the agent and ask if their player will come to Sunderland and want to fight against relegation. Yes or no? If it’s yes, let’s talk. If it’s no, on to the next one.”

Stoke City weigh up making bid for West Brom’s Saido Berahino
~~AUTHOR~~
Stuart James
~CONTENTS~
Stoke City are closely monitoring Saido Berahino’s situation at West Bromwich Albion and are considering making an offer for the striker, who looks increasingly likely to leave the Midlands club this month in pursuit of a fresh start to revive a promising career that has badly unravelled.Mark Hughes has admitted that Stoke are interested in strengthening their squad if the right player becomes available and it is understood that serious thought is now being given to tabling a bid for Berahino to bolster their attack.Marko Arnautovic casts doubt over Stoke future by rejecting contract offer Read moreBerahino has not started a league game in more than two months and his name will feature prominently when Tony Pulis, West Brom’s manager, meets the club chairman, Jeremy Peace, on Friday to discuss transfer plans.Pulis has become increasingly exasperated with Berahino and is likely to see the 22-year-old’s departure as a way of raising funds to improve his squad and, at the same time, removing a problem.Peace, however, will have the final say and if one thing can be said for certain it is that Berahino will not be allowed to leave on the cheap. Tottenham Hotspur discovered that was the case back in the summer, when they tabled four bids, including a final offer of £22.5m, but were unable to persuade Peace to sell.Spurs are in the market for a striker now and remain interested in Berahino but there is a major question mark over how much they would bid for a player whose value can only have fallen on the back of a troubled and disappointing first half of the season.There is also the not insignificant issue of the Spurs chairman, Daniel Levy, and Peace negotiating hard and trying to reach an agreement that finishes with both men feeling as if they have won.Stoke, in that sense, could prove a less problematic option if the club decide to turn their interest into something more concrete. Berahino is viewed as being a difficult customer but Stoke would be unfazed by that reputation and Hughes has already demonstrated that he is capable of getting wayward players back on track.

Jürgen Klopp to field young, inexperienced Liverpool against Exeter in FA Cup
~~AUTHOR~~
Andy Hunter
~CONTENTS~
The extent of the injury crisis afflicting Liverpool has been laid bare with Jürgen Klopp considering a central defence of José Enrique and Tiago Ilori for the FA Cup tie at Exeter City.Liverpool will take a threadbare, inexperienced squad to St James Park for Friday’s third-round match, with eight of the likely starting XI having played four matches or fewer for the club. Three are in line for their debuts.With 12 players sidelined through injury and Klopp refusing to risk those involved in four games in 11 days over the festive period, Nathaniel Clyne, Alberto Moreno and Emre Can will not start against the League Two side. Philippe Coutinho and Dejan Lovren, who sustained hamstring injuries in Tuesday’s Capital One Cup semi-final win at Stoke City, have been ruled out for at least the rest of January and 10 days respectively and Kolo Touré misses the tie having suffered cramp at the Britannia Stadium.Jordon Ibe gives Liverpool advantage against Stoke in Capital One Cup Read moreTouré’s absence deprives Liverpool of all their experienced central defenders and such is the paucity of options that Enrique, who has not played in 12 months, and Ilori, who has never featured for the club since arriving in 2013, could start. The Spanish left-back last appeared for Liverpool in the FA Cup draw against Bolton Wanderers on 24 January last year and has played 84 minutes since December 2014. He was frozen out by the former Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers having rejected opportunities to leave Anfield and was training apart from the senior squad when Klopp arrived in October.Asked whether Enrique was in his plans for Exeter, Klopp replied: “Who?” Once clarified, he continued: “Hopefully. We don’t have too many centre-backs so it is an idea. But we have to see. He played the day before yesterday as a full-back for 90 minutes. We all need training but in this game we could need his experience.”Ilori must prove his fitness before his inclusion against Paul Tisdale’s team is decided. The Portugal Under-21 international had his season-long loan at Aston Villa terminated on Thursday having not played a game for the Premier League’s bottom club. Klopp said of the £7m signing from Sporting Lisbon: “I don’t know how he is. He was injured a few weeks ago and now he is in training. I think he played for Aston Villa’s second team a few times and he should be available.”   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest  Liverpool’s Jürgen Klopp forced to field makeshift side against Exeter City.Klopp’s only selection guarantee was that the Liverpool team would be “very young, that’s for sure” and not include his regular starters across the festive programme. The Liverpool manager, whose side host Arsenal and Manchester United in the Premier League next week, said: “There are the injuries but you can also be influenced by an intensive period of football [when selecting a side] and so none of the players who played the last five or six games in a row will play at Exeter. That is not possible. Then we can try and make a team. It is not easy, but we will try and find one.”Ilori and the forwards Ryan Kent and Sheyi Ojo may make their first Liverpool appearances. The full-backs Connor Randall and Brad Smith, the midfielders João Carlos Teixeira and Cameron Brannagan and the goalkeeper Adam Bogdan could start. Between them they have played 15 times for the club.Klopp accepts his team are exposed to an FA Cup upset against a side 16th in League Two. “It is a chance for Exeter and they have to take it,” he said. But the man who led Borussia Dortmund to three German Cup finals in his last four seasons at the club insists his selection will not be a sign of disrespecting the FA Cup.Klopp said: “We have the situation that we have. We cannot play with Phil Coutinho – he cannot play for three and a half weeks at least. That is the situation. If someone wants to write headlines it is not the truth because we respect the FA Cup. There is one reason for the team we will play tomorrow.”Liverpool are scouring the transfer market for defensive reinforcement before Arsenal’s visit to Anfield next Wednesday, with Borussia Dortmund’s Neven Subotic and Internazionale’s Andrea Ranocchia among several under consideration. Klopp denied claims, aired this week by the former Liverpool manager Graeme Souness and Sunderland’s Sam Allardyce, that his training regime and high-intensity pressing game are to blame for the injury problems. “Our play is not that intensive,” he said. “Maybe the first game at Tottenham was more intensive than other games. We made a few more sprints, but not 500 more. It’s normal, average running. Football is not all about more running, it’s about more in the right moment. It’s about thinking quicker.”Allardyce on Thursday apologised for his comments, saying: “I didn’t mean to upset you or criticise your club in any way.”The Liverpool manager revealed he had to start Coutinho against Stoke as Jordon Ibe was struggling with illness and Christian Benteke had an achilles problem. “Phil had played a lot of games and so we planned to change at half-time but then, 18 minutes, bang. That is the situation. If we could have changed players more often then no one would have had this intensity [of games] but you cannot have 40 or 50 players.”

Robert Martínez: no verbal agreement with Everton stars about summer exits
~~AUTHOR~~
Andy Hunter
~CONTENTS~
Roberto Martínez has denied having a verbal agreement with Romelu Lukaku, John Stones or any Everton player that they can leave this summer and insisted he would never consent to such a counterproductive strategy.Lukaku’s agent, Mino Raiola, claimed in a French radio interview last year that Martínez had said he would allow the prolific striker to move “if a good offer comes in”. The Everton manager has seen Stones develop into one of the most coveted defenders in Europe and told him that last summer was the wrong time to leave after offers from Chelsea.Everton’s Romelu Lukaku pounces to leave Manchester City with uphill task Read moreMartínez admitted before Everton’s Capital One Cup semi-final first-leg win over Manchester City that Champions League qualification would be more persuasive to keeping young talent at the club than victory in the competition. But he has rejected the suggestion that players have an agreement they can leave should Everton, 11th in the Premier League, fall short.“That is not true, I would never do that,” the Everton manager said. “I think that would be very negative. If you do that could you imagine the last two months for that player? He would never put a leg in or never challenge for the ball. I don’t agree with doing that. I know you can do that to keep a player for another 12 months but if you’re not going to have a player 12 months down the line you need to start replacing him to have a stronger team.”Everton have started work for next season by completing the £3m signing of the highly rated Switzerland Under-21 international Shani Tarashaj from Grasshoppers Zurich. The 20-year-old who plays as a second striker or attacking midfielder, has scored eight goals in 18 appearances for Grasshoppers this season, attracting attention from Juventus, Internazionale, Villarreal and Sevilla. But Everton moved swiftly to secure his signature, on the condition he remains on loan at the Swiss club for the rest of the season to complete his national service. Tarashaj signed a four-and-a-half-year contract with Everton on Thursday.Martínez said: “Shani is an enormous young talent in Swiss football who, without a doubt, will have a great future. He fits in really well to our style and the way we want to play the game. He is a family boy, hungry and he is desperate to fight for his place in our talented young squad. I’m delighted we have been able to act quickly and secure the deal for Shani which means that, due to his national service commitments, he will be able to be part of our first team squad from next season.”Séamus Coleman is expected to be out for three to four weeks with the calf strain suffered against City. Lukaku injured an ankle in the semi-final and Tom Cleverley aggravated a calf problem but, while not believed to be serious injuries, the pair are likely to miss Saturday’s FA Cup tie against Dagenham and Redbridge.

Arsène Wenger gives Arsenal injury update and rules Alexis Sánchez out
~CONTENTS~
Arsène Wenger has confirmed Alexis Sánchez will not be risked in Arsenal’s FA Cup third-round tie with Sunderland on Saturday.The 27-year-old missed the entire festive fixture list having suffered a hamstring injury in the 1-1 draw at Norwich in November.Sánchez was expected to make his comeback for the win over title rivals Manchester City before Christmas but suffered a setback in his recovery.In his absence, Arsenal have opened up a two-point lead at the top of the Premier League and begin their defence of the FA Cup against Sunderland.Rémi Garde wants Arsenal’s Mathieu Debuchy to join Aston Villa Read moreWenger is not ready to rush Sánchez back into his side with crucial league fixtures to come at Liverpool and Stoke next week.“The bad news of the week is that Alexis is not quite ready,” said Wenger. “It is a precaution because of his hamstring, and it takes a few more days. He’s not bad but he’s not ready.“The thinking is to give absolutely everything to qualify. We are the holders of the Cup and I know as well by experience that it is very important that you get in the competition and that you have a successful third round. It’s a tricky one, always, the third round.”There is better news on the club captain Mikel Arteta’s recovery from a calf injury while Wenger also offered an update on the midfielders Tomas Rosicky, Santi Cazorla and Francis Coquelin – all of whom are sidelined with knee issues.“Tomas Rosicky is not far, he’s back in full training next week, so should be available soon. Mikel is available,” he added.“Nothing has changed [from the original timescale] with Santi. It could be a bit shorter with him because he’s often quicker [at recovering] than you expect him to be. Cazorla and Coquelin are doing well.”

The former England international has agreed a deal until the end of the season after being on loan at the Ricoh Arena since October.The 34-year-old won the Premier League and FA Cup three times with Chelsea and earned 56 caps for his country.How did Joe Cole, once England's great hope, end up on loan in League One? Read moreCole has made seven appearances for Coventry, scoring once, and their manager, Tony Mowbray, has praised the midfielder’s impact on the League One promotion hopefuls. Mowbray said: “Since he joined the club, I’ve really enjoyed working with Joe and am delighted to see him sign on for the rest of the season.“Our staff have worked hard with him to build up his fitness and physicality, and we’ve seen Joe really buy into what we’re trying to do here. He’s great to have around the dressing room and the rest of the squad feed off his experience, and I’m sure it’ll have a positive impact on our younger players as well.“I only see his performances for the club getting better and he is a fantastic option to have from now until the end of the season.”Cole played 16 times for Villa after being released by West Ham in 2014 – his second spell at Upton Park – but had only made one appearance for them this season.

The 25-year-old centre-back has joined from Bayern Munich on an 18-month deal for a fee understood to be in the region of £750,000.Lorient slam Sunderland’s conduct after deal for Lamine Koné collapses Read moreKirchhoff moved to Bayern from Mainz in 2013 and went on to spend two spells on loan with another Bundesliga side, Schalke.The Sunderland manager, Sam Allardyce, said: “He has good pedigree – he started playing first-team football at 17 or 18 years old at Mainz and that he progressed to a club as big as Bayern Munich shows he has talent. He’s frustrated at not being able to play a bigger part in Bayern’s team in the time he’s been there and he wants to experience the Premier League.”Although the 6ft 5in Kirchhoff has played as a central defender for most of his career, he also showed his versatility by assuming a central midfield role during his time at Schalke.The signing of Kirchhoff is a timely boost for Allardyce who experienced frustration in his respective interest in QPR’s Steven Caulker and Lorient’s Lamine Gassama.

Puzzle-loving Matt Oakley gives Exeter clues on how to beat Liverpool
~~AUTHOR~~
Stuart James
~CONTENTS~
As Matt Oakley prepares to face Liverpool for the 17th time in his career, Exeter City’s evergreen 38-year-old can be forgiven for needing a gentle reminder that the first of those meetings took place at Anfield so long ago that John Barnes was lining up against him.It was December 1995, Oakley was 18, making the second of his 251 Premier League appearances, and Southampton came away with a 1-1 draw. While the memories of that day are a little hazy – much like the 3-2 win at Anfield three years later when Oakley was unable to continue after David James cleaned him out when conceding an early penalty – playing against Liverpool left a deep impression on him in one sense.“Anfield was the first place where I’d ever seen a crowd influence a game,” Oakley says. “I remember Liverpool had a spell of play where they were on top, the crowd just went through the roof and I’ve never felt anything like it. It was as if you’d gone deaf. There was this noise going on, I couldn’t communicate with a team-mate five yards away. They were passing the ball with ease, like Liverpool can, and they tore us apart. And I just thought: ‘Oh my God.’ You kind of realised why the home team usually wins. That day at Liverpool was the loudest thing I’d ever heard.”Exeter’s Paul Tisdale ready to battle Jürgen Klopp in hipster stakes and Cup Read moreSt James Park is a long way from Anfield in every respect but the Exeter supporters among an 8,300 sellout crowd will be doing their best on Friday to raise the decibel levels for a classic third-round FA Cup tie and an occasion that has given Oakley, who was in the Southampton side that lost to Arsenal in the 2003 final, plenty to think about.Long fascinated by analytics in sport as well as psychology, which he hopes to study at university after passing a couple of exams, Oakley is partly responsible for plotting Liverpool’s downfall as the man in charge of preparing the dossiers on Exeter’s opponents. With one eye on the future, the former Southampton, Derby and Leicester midfielder is a player, scout and GCSE student wrapped into one these days.“I don’t want to go into a coaching role, I don’t get a buzz from that,” says Oakley, who has clocked up 135 games for Exeter since arriving on loan in 2011 to help out Paul Tisdale, the League Two club’s manager and a former Southampton team-mate. “I like puzzles and I like working things out, so the analysis stuff is something that interests me. I spent a bit of time with Chris Anderson, who wrote the book The Numbers Game, to see how his brain works.“My thinking is that when I’ve been at clubs we’ve had analysis people doing presentations for games and they’ll show a bit of footage but it’s more computer-techy-university people, not players. I’m not saying they can’t do it and they can’t see it but they don’t get what I think I can give. I guess I’m trying to create a bit of a niche – I’ve played at the top and every level, so I understand what players are thinking.”Unable to see opponents play live because he is still regularly turning out for Exeter, Oakley receives a report from a scout attending the match and combines their thoughts with his own analysis after watching a full rerun of the game on his computer. He then gives a presentation to Tisdale a couple of days before the match so that they can prepare tactics.“The beauty of this particular game is we’ve been able to get great footage of Liverpool,” Oakley says. “But it’s also the first time I’ve had to look at a Premier League team and say: ‘If I’m playing against them, how am I going to break them down?’“Obviously I tried to do it as a footballer but I was told by someone else. Or, as was the case with a few of my managers, just told to go out and play and get stuck in. So I’ve really enjoyed this, but I’m not going to tell you what I’ve broken down about Liverpool.”Fresh-faced and still full of running, Oakley looks much younger than his age and it seems remarkable to think he made his debut at Goodison Park at a time when Neville Southall was in goal for Everton. Oakley can still see Anders Limpar delivering a cross that he worried he was going to head into his own net with his first touch in professional football and he also smiles at the memory of Southampton players lighting up cigarettes on the coach on the way home.He was a trainee at the time and on a nice little earner as Matt Le Tissier’s boot boy, who agreed to pay him £5 for every goal he scored during that 1994-95 season (Le Tissier had parted with £150 come the end). Oakley was never quite sure Le Tissier appreciated all his hard work. “I remember spending hours cleaning his boots, shining them as much as I could, and he would then go and stick them in the sink and wet them because he wanted them more supple.”Oakley spent 12 years with Southampton and was probably playing some of the best football of his career when he suffered a cruciate ligament injury in September 2003 that kept him out for 15 months. Gordon Strachan, who was Southampton’s manager at the time, had been pushing Oakley’s claims for a full England call-up in the previous campaign, which ended with a 1-0 defeat against a superb Arsenal side in a largely forgettable FA Cup final.“Up until that point in the Cup we’d have a go at teams and thought we would overpower them but we tried to do the same at Highbury in a league game just before the final and got battered 6-1,” Oakley says.“I remember Gordon, in the buildup to the final, sitting us down and saying: ‘We can go two ways with this. We either go for them and get done 5-0, which will be embarrassing. Or we slightly adjust what we’re doing.’ We went down the latter route. Robert Pirès scored, we had the odd couple of chances but it was a little bit flat.”By that stage Oakley had already developed a serious interest in sports psychology, which started while working under Glenn Hoddle at Southampton – he remembers feeling “gutted” when the former England manager telephoned him to say he was leaving to take over at Tottenham Hotspur – and continued throughout his career, so much so he decided to try to take things further last year.“I applied to go to the University of Roehampton to do a sports psychology degree. I went to the open day and met with the head of the psychology side, talked about what I’d done, with 22 years of professional football behind me, and she said she thought I’d be fantastic for the course because I can talk about real-life situations that they try to educate people on.“But I failed at the application stage because you needed five GCSEs, which I’ve got but I don’t have English and maths. That deflated me a little bit. But my wife works as a teaching assistant and she supports a maths teacher, so my first step is get maths sorted and then do the English one.”Having played under some colourful characters, including Sven-Goran Eriksson, Nigel Pearson and Ian Holloway at Leicester, Billy Davies at Derby, and Strachan and Hoddle at Southampton, Oakley will not be short of material for his case studies when he finally enrols on the psychology course.In the meantime, he is thoroughly enjoying life at Exeter and hoping his latest appearance against Liverpool – and probably his last – will deliver one of those magical FA Cup moments.“It’s chalk and cheese in terms of quality,” Oakley says, “but the pitch is going to be crap, the changing rooms – bless the club – are what they are, and the weather is probably going to be rubbish. And, as the old saying goes, it’s a one-off game.”

Suspended Michel Platini formally withdraws from Fifa presidential race
~CONTENTS~
Michel Platini has formally withdrawn his candidacy for the Fifa presidency and said he will dedicate himself to overturning his eight-year ban.The Uefa president, banned by Fifa’s ethics committee from all football-related activity for eight years over a 2m Swiss franc payment (£1.3m) he received from the Fifa president Sepp Blatter in 2011, said he had originally received 150 declarations of support when he announced he would run but had now been forced to pull out of the election on 26 February - it is also unclear whether any appeal process would have been completed by that date.The move by the 60-year-old will clear the path for the other five candidates in the race to succeed Blatter as there was still the possibility that Platini could stand if he had overturned the ban on appeal.Platini told L’Equipe: “I will not present myself as president of Fifa. I withdraw my candidacy. I cannot, I do not have the time or the means to go the voters, to meet people, to fight against the others.“By removing myself, I make the choice to dedicate myself to my defence against a dossier where there is no mention of corruption, of falsification, forgery, where there is nothing any more.”Platini had been the clear favourite to succeed Blatter but his election campaign was stopped in its tracks when details of the 2011 payment were revealed in September. It then emerged the payment was based on only an oral agreement made with Blatter 13 years before when he worked as technical adviser to the Fifa president.The Frenchman was provisionally banned for 90 days which stopped him campaigning, and the eight-year ban imposed on 21 December, in effect, ended his chances.He added: “How can one win an election when one is prevented from campaigning. Yet when Blatter announced his retirement, I received 150 declarations of support - 100 official letters from federations and 50 promises. All this in two days.“Now I must follow all the procedures - the Cas [Court of Arbitration for Sport] and the [electoral] commission chaired by Domenico Scala who said that I had falsified accounts.“I would have fought as I have always done in my life but I was not given the opportunity to compete this time around.”The Asian football president Sheikh Salman bin Ebrahim al-Khalifa has emerged as the new favourite to lead Fifa but he faces competition from Prince Ali bin al Hussein of Jordan, the Frenchman Jerôme Champagne, South Africa’s Tokyo Sexwale, and Gianni Infantino, the Swiss lawyer who for the last five years has been Platini’s right-hand man as Uefa’s general secretary.

Swansea City appoint Alan Curtis as manager until the end of the season
~~AUTHOR~~
Stuart James
~CONTENTS~
Swansea City have confirmed Alan Curtis will remain in charge until the end of the season after conceding defeat in their attempts to appoint a permanent successor to Garry Monk and pinning their hopes on finding the right man in the summer provided they retain their Premier League status.In a long and brutally honest statement, Huw Jenkins, the chairman, admitted Swansea sacked Monk in December without having a replacement lined up and also revealed the Welsh club ran into major difficulties when trying to convince potential candidates to take over at the Liberty Stadium mid-season, partly because people were already in employment but also as a result of Swansea’s precarious league position.Marcelo Bielsa, the experienced Argentinian, Brendan Rodgers, the former Swansea manager, and Unai Emery, who is currently in charge of Sevilla, were among who came under consideration and it may well be that Jenkins revisits some of those names at the end of the season, assuming Curtis can stave off the threat of relegation.The decision to stick with Curtis, who has picked up five points from his five games in charge, hardly came as a surprise, although some will view it as a risky strategy given what is at stake – Swansea are currently 17th and only two points above the relegation zone – and also question the merits of dismissing Monk without having a plan B in place.“I know some people will query why we didn’t have a replacement lined up when we parted company with Garry Monk but we didn’t expect to be in the situation we were in when you look at our position mid-September,” Jenkins said. “We hoped and expected things would eventually turn around. When they didn’t, we felt we had to act quickly in the best interests of the club going forward.“Finding a replacement hasn’t been easy because we didn’t want to make a short-term decision that would be detrimental to the club long term. It’s a unique situation for us and I think we are only now appreciating what other Premier League clubs in our position have gone through in the last five years.“We’ve spoken to a lot of potential managers. Some didn’t want to leave the clubs they were at at this late stage in the season, while others didn’t want to put their reputation on the line by joining a club at the wrong end of the table. In the end, we felt the best decision was to change as little as we can until taking stock in the summer.”Curtis has a long and distinguished association with Swansea going back to his days as a player, and the board have been impressed with the way the 61-year-old has galvanised the players in the wake of Monk’s departure. “We have a person at the helm who fully represents all Swansea City stands for, has the respect of the players and who will provide the calm reassurance and encouragement of our footballing beliefs,” Jenkins said.

Diego Costa and Oscar separated after Chelsea training confrontation

David Hytner
~CONTENTS~
Win (home) tickets to Chelsea v West Bromwich Albion Read moreDiego Costa and Oscar had to be cooled down by some of their Chelsea team-mates after a flare-up during Thursday’s training session at Cobham. Costa had gone in hard on Oscar with a tackle and the midfielder responded with an extremely heavy one of his own that caused the pair to square up.The session was highly charged, as the squad prepared for Sunday’s FA Cup third round tie at home to Scunthorpe United and, briefly, it looked as though Costa and Oscar were ready to trade punches. But the swift intervention of team-mates who were close to the flashpoint stopped things from escalating.Guus Hiddink, the interim manager, was laid-back about the incident, having seen this kind of thing many times over his long career and it was laughed off afterwards, with both of the Brazil-born players making their peace.Oscar later went on Twitter to play down the incident, saying the pair had not come to blows. “For those who are talking to me and @diegocosta struggle today in training he’s lying, he’s one of my best friends and never fight,” wrote the 24-year-old.Oscar (@oscar8)Pra quem está falando que eu e o @diegocosta brigamos hoje no treino está mentindo,Ele é um dos meus melhores amigos e jamais iríamos brigarJanuary 7, 2016Costa and Oscar have endured poor seasons but they have shown signs of better form since Hiddink replaced José Mourinho last month, reinforcing the feeling that their relationships with the former manager had broken down.Both of them were prominent in last Sunday’s 3-0 win at Crystal Palace, which was one of the club’s best performances of the season and meant that they had taken eight points from the available 12 since Mourinho’s departure.Costa was booed by fans in the first game after Mourinho had left – the 3-1 home win over Sunderland – with the accusation clear that he was considered to be one of the principal under-performers to cost the Portuguese his job. But he has since heard his name chanted in the stands, most recently at Palace, when he created the first goal for Oscar and scored the third himself.Radamel Falcao was present at Cobham on Thursday after he flew back to his parent club, Monaco, earlier this week. The on-loan Colombia striker returned to the Principality for checks on his thigh injury at Monaco’s training ground, before a potential permanent return to the club.Falcao was hoping to resurrect his ailing career at Chelsea but, halfway through a season-long loan, he has scored only one goal. The 29-year-old has not played since the end of October due to a thigh injury and he is expected to be out for at least another week because of it. He is open to cutting short his loan this month and returning to Monaco.

Ronald Koeman: Sadio Mané and Victor Wanyama will stay at Southampton
~CONTENTS~
Ronald Koeman will let Sadio Mané and Victor Wanyama sit “in the stands” if they agitate for a move away from Southampton. The manager has insisted the pair will remain at St Mary’s beyond the January transfer window despite strong interest from other Premier League clubs.Koeman dropped Mané for last Saturday’s 1-0 league defeat at Norwich City after the Senegal forward was late for a team meeting, sparking fresh speculation he was headed for a transfer. But the Dutchman has continued to reject suggestions either Mané or Wanyama is itching for a move and vowed to banish anyone misbehaving in an attempt to force a transfer.Sadio Mané is in demand but shopping for Saints comes at a price | Jacob Steinberg Read more“If there is any player thinking if his behaviour is not good that makes it more easier for the player, then I’ll put the player in the stands until the end of their contract,” said Koeman. “Because in my opinion that’s not the way you have to do your job as a football player.”Wanyama, a holding midfielder, has 18 months left on his deal, and Koeman said Southampton are continuing efforts to discuss a new long-term contract. Mané signed a four-year deal when he joined Southampton in 2014 but has been the subject of consistent speculation amid keen interest from Manchester United.Southampton could look to cash in on Wanyama in the summer if he opts not to sign a contract, mirroring the process with Morgan Schneiderlin, who joined Manchester United last summer. However, Koeman insisted Mané and Wanyama are focused and enjoying their football.Wanyama was sent off at Norwich, with the second yellow card described as stupid by Koeman. The Kenyan apologised for his behaviour, which he accepted was “reckless and irresponsible”.Koeman said of Mané’s and Wanyama’s commitment: “I’m not doubting that. That’s the daily basis in communication with the players and it’s too easy to mention after the mistake of Sadio or the second yellow that the players are showing that they like to move.“It’s too easy and it’s not like that. The players know the position in the club and what we think about the players. That’s no reason to doubt about that. I don’t have doubts about that. They are important players and they like to be here. They like to continue, they like to make a good season, and that’s the most important. They are still happy. The contacts is to the players, the contacts is to the agents, and I have to believe in my players.”The England goalkeeper Fraser Forster is closing on a return after nine months out recovering from knee surgery but Koeman said Saturday’s FA Cup third-round tie against Crystal Palace had come too soon.“First of all we’re very pleased Fraser played his first game in nine months, on a good level,” said Koeman after Forster featured for Southampton’s Under-21s. “This weekend is too soon in our opinion and he will play again with the Under-21s on Monday.“Then after that we will have discussions about what we have to do about our goalkeepers and finally the best will start. But that will start after Monday.”

Alan Pardew hits back at Neil Warnock over Charlie Austin comments
~CONTENTS~
Alan Pardew has dismissed Neil Warnock’s comments after the former Crystal Palace manager said he thought Charlie Austin would be a good fit at Selhurst Park.Pardew took exception to Warnock’s remarks on TalkSport earlier in the week and responded before Crystal Palace’s FA Cup game at Southampton on Saturday.“Neil Warnock was the manager here and he didn’t do very well so I am not really interested in his opinion,” said Pardew. “Charlie Austin is of no interest to us.”Pardew also criticised the transfer rumours concerning the club, saying there was no truth in any of the stories linking names with a move to Palace in January.He said: “I have seen all the players that have been linked with us and not one of those is true. Somebody is giving out false information. We are looking at one or two choices but the names that have been linked with us, it is not them.”Crystal Palace have suffered with injuries this season but Pardew believes the side are over the worst of it with Bakary Sako available for this weekend and Dwight Gayle and Connor Wickham scheduled to be fit to face Aston Villa on Tuesday.He added: “We had a little period at the start of the season which made us address some issues in the medical team. I have been much more comfortable during this injury crisis that our medical team have been spot on.“I like to think when these guys come back they won’t break down. You can never say never but I feel a little bit more confident.”

The ludicrous footballing overstatement klaxon
~~AUTHOR~~
Simon Burnton
~CONTENTS~
NO NEWS IS NO NEWSThe Fiver was enjoying a pleasant mid-morning nap – we try to peak in the early afternoon, as you know – when we were abruptly woken by the sounding of our trademarked ludicrous footballing overstatement klaxon. We’d forgotten about the klaxon, which has sat silent in a corner of our cluttered work-shed since Asmir Begovic called José Mourinho “the best manager in the world” back in October, and even then it made just a small parp, nothing compared with this morning’s lusty trumpeting. Startled, we dragged ourself to our feet and dug out the klaxon, buried under a pile of match programmes and our well-thumbed copy of 101 Football Funnies for the Desperate Humorist, to see what it was so excited about. Even more startled, a few moments later we collapsed back in our chair having discovered that, high on Everton’s Milk Cup win over Manchester City, Bobby M had labelled Gareth Barry “one of the best English players ever”.Don’t get us wrong, The Fiver is a big fan of Gary Barry, believing him to be one of the more reliable English midfielders of the last decade-and-a-bit. If pushed, we’d go so far as to name him perhaps the finest and most intelligent Sussex-born footballer of modern times (Brighton-born former Watford utility man Steve Palmer may not have won any England caps but he had a degree in software engineering from Cambridge, so it’s a close-run thing). He has blossomed into the kind of midfield mainstay that people tend to describe with admiration, with affection, but also with a few caveats.“I would say Gareth is the most consistent player at Aston Villa,” said Scott Carson in 2008, which seemed reasonable enough. Later that year his team-mate Stilian Petrov described Barry as “a world-class player” and “the main guy in England’s midfield”, an assertion that Big Paper described as “at least tenable” (though it would be remiss not to point out that in the same interview Petrov announced that John Carew was “strong, quick and on his day the best striker in the world”). Martin O’Neill, one of his managers at Villa Park, once said “Gareth is a very strong character. He’s got real determination, and he’s got more ability than people think,” which as praise goes seems on the underwhelming side, even if it prompted Barry himself to trill that “it’s good reading your manager bigging you up like that”.When, at the peak of his career, Barry signed for City, his new boss, Mark Hughes, claimed that he was “widely acknowledged as one of the top midfielders in the Premier League”, which was perhaps a little enthusiastic but not downright ridiculous. Hughes’s successor, Roberto Mancini, went with: “He’s a good man, a clever man, both on and off the pitch.” This raises the possibility of attributes being in some way geographically-restricted – as if someone might have unusually fine eyesight but only when in kitchens, or be extraordinarily good at ballroom dancing, though only when not in ballrooms – but otherwise seems effusive without toppling into lunatic excess. Indeed a couple of years ago Martínez got it about right when he said of Barry that “at the moment I don’t think there is another English midfielder of his type who brings what he brings”. Sadly he has since decided to cut the vital phrases “at the moment”, “midfielder of his type” and “brings what he brings”, and replace them with “in the entire history of all humanity”, “footballer of any kind” and “is anywhere near as good”, respectively. One man, however, won’t be surprised by Martínez’s – or, indeed, any coach’s – enthusiasm for the one-paced nearly-35-year-old. “He always agrees with the manager,” Joey Barton said of Barry in 2011. “He’s like the guy who sits in the front row and listens to the teacher.” Still, The Fiver is pleased for Barry, who will no doubt find that it’s good reading your manager bigging you up like this – but also, truth be told, a little baffling.QUOTE OF THE DAY“You cannot say we were violent. There wasn’t any blood. If we wanted, Barça would have gone off on stretchers” – Espanyol’s Papakouly Diop – sent off after telling Luis Suarez “I $hit in your wh0re mother” – denies his side had a bad attitude in their 4-1 Copa del Rey defeat at Barcelona.

Radamel Falcao may cut Chelsea loan short and return to Monaco
~CONTENTS~
Radamel Falcao flew back to Monaco for checks on his thigh injury earlier this week before a potential return to the Ligue 1 club.Didier Drogba retirement report premature despite links to Chelsea Read moreThe striker was hoping to resurrect his ailing career at Chelsea this season but halfway through his loan with the Premier League champions he has scored only one goal. Falcao has not played for Chelsea since the end of October because of the injury and is expected to be out for at least another week.Having travelled to Monaco, the Colombian returned to Chelsea’s training ground on Wednesday and was at the complex in Cobham on Thursday too. But he is understood to be considering an attempt to cut his loan short and return to his parent club.With Diego Costa and Loïc Rémy ahead of him in the Chelsea pecking order, Falcao appears unlikely to get much playing time for the rest of the season, which is of concern to the former Atlético Madrid forward. If Chelsea cannot offer him regular first-team football for the rest of the campaign, it is understood he would prefer to return to Monaco where his contract expires in 2018.Monaco signed Falco from Atlético in 2013 for £52m but he spent only one season in Ligue 1, suffering a major knee injury midway through, before embarking on a disappointing loan spell at Manchester United in which he scored four goals in 29 appearances.

Lorient slam Sunderland’s conduct after deal for Lamine Koné collapses
~~AUTHOR~~
Ed Aarons
~CONTENTS~
Lorient’s vice-president has criticised Sunderland’s conduct after the Premier League side pulled out of a deal for Ivorian defender Lamine Koné.Sunderland had a bid accepted for the 27-year-old at the end of last month and Koné appeared set to become Sam Allardyce’s first signing of the transfer window last week.Sadio Mané is in demand but shopping for Saints comes at a price | Jacob Steinberg Read moreHowever, with Bayern Munich’s Jan Kirchhoff having been pictured at the club’s training ground on Wednesday as he arrived for a medical, Lorient vice-president Alex Hayes confirmed that the move for Koné is now off.“It’s quite outrageous,” Hayes told French newspaper Le Télégramme. “We gave Sunderland our consent last Tuesday, Lamine left the next day to have contract talks, but the player warned us there were problems in negotiating his contract.“Because of the holidays it dragged out until Monday. They tried to change the pre-agreed deal. Lamine called me to ask if he could return to Lorient and I told him with great pleasure.”Koné missed last weekend’s cup victory over Tours and will not be available for this weekend’s Ligue 1 fixture against Rennes after missing training.“Our defensive pillar was lost for the cup game against Tours and for the Rennes derby, for nothing,” said Hayes, who added that the club are now exploring legal options.“It’s quite outrageous on the part of Sunderland who, meanwhile, have negotiated with a Bayern player.”

Muhamed Besic, the cultured scrapper who could turn out to be an Everton gem
~~AUTHOR~~
Jonathan Wilson
~CONTENTS~
It was only Muhamed Besic’s third start of the season but if he was anxious he hid it well. Standing in the tunnel before the Capital One Cup semi-final first leg against Manchester City, he yawned. He went on to produce his best performance in an Everton shirt, a cultured scrapper buzzing around the more sedentary solidity of Gareth Barry.It is easy to be carried along by Roberto Martínez’s ebullience – although not so easy as not to raise an eyebrow when he describes Barry as one the great players in English history – but the match provided much for Everton fans to be optimistic about, and nothing more than Besic’s performance.Everton’s Muhamed Besic: Why I didn’t ask for Messi’s World Cup shirt Read moreAmong Everton players, only Barry touched the ball more than the 23-year-old. Most impressive, perhaps, was his calmness in the closing minutes as Everton, particularly after being reduced to 10 men by the late injury to Seamus Coleman, denied City the ball by keeping possession. The Goodison Park crowd, as it showed in its reaction to John Stones’s Cruyff turns against Tottenham in the previous game on Sunday, has little patience for overindulgence, but Besic, forever delaying a pass until a gap appeared, won applause. It was an odd 10 minutes against a City side producing yet another slightly lackadaisical performance but Besic’s movement and use of the ball in that spell spoke of a profound footballing intelligence.The passing, though, was only part of it. Besic also made six tackles – five more than anyone else who started the game for Everton – and an interception. He was aggressive and mobile. All but one of his tackles were made in a line about 30 yards from his own goal, while his passing was spread across the pitch but particularly towards the right, where he linked up with Gerard Deulofeu.Besic started the 3-1 win over Chelsea in September but was forced off after nine minutes with a hamstring injury. He had made only two substitute appearances before his start on Wednesday, although the second of those had been highly encouraging. It had arguably been his introduction in Sunday’s 1-1 draw with Tottenham that turned the match Everton’s way in the second half. After that game Martínez described him as “a contagious footballer” and it was notable he was the first to approach Stones as the crowd barracked him after his Cruyff turns. He is certainly not shy.Nor is he, it is fair to say, an easy character. When he was 14 he was banned by the youth side for which he played in Berlin, shrugged and told his father that it didn’t matter, he’d still become the best player in the world. Or at least that is how the story goes: it has been repeated so frequently in the Bosnian media it has become gospel, although it is not entirely clear either which team he was playing for at the time or the precise reason for being banned. It may be it is an anecdote longer on emotional truth than facts: this is the type of thing a 14-year-old Besic should have done.In 2012, by which time he had joined Hamburg, Besic rowed on the pitch with his coach Thorsten Fink, who ended up grabbing him by the throat. Besic left for Ferencvaros soon afterwards. Then in September last year he was sent off in Bosnia’s World Cup qualifying win over Andorra, having reacted to a heavy challenge by throwing his chewing gum into the face of an opponent (although not, as it turned out, the one who had fouled him).Born in Berlin of Bosnian parents, Besic was a surprise selection for Bosnia’s opening game of the 2014 World Cup, in which they lost 2-1 to Argentina. His performance then meant he went overnight in Bosnia from being almost unknown to being hailed as the future of their football, while anybody who heard Martínez’s punditry on the game would have been aware how highly he rated the midfielder. He signed him later in the summer for £4m.“Mo has got a very natural balance about knowing that he can be strong and aggressive but in the same way he’s a technical player on the ball,” Martínez said after Besic’s first friendly for Everton. “He’ll have that power to cope with the physicality of the league but also he has the comfort on the ball – in his long pass and short pass.”It is that range of abilities, the combination of ball-playing and ball-winning that so stood out against City. One full game and a substitute appearance represent limited evidence but the signs are extremely positive. Besic probably won’t fulfil the boast he supposedly made at 14 but he could turn out to be an extremely valuable player for Everton – and then there is a decent chance his manager at least will describe him as the best player in the world.

Watford say Troy Deeney and Odion Ighalo are staying put
~CONTENTS~
The Watford manager, Quique Sánchez Flores, insists it is “completely impossible” that Troy Deeney or Odion Ighalo will be sold during the current transfer window but could offer no assurances beyond the end of the season.The captain Deeney has been linked with a move to Arsenal in recent days while the club’s leading goalscorer Ighalo has stated it is his dream to one day play for Manchester United.Both have been in fine form for the Hornets this season as Flores has guided the promoted side to ninth in the Premier League table.They host struggling Newcastle in the FA Cup on Saturday and, while Ighalo or Deeney may yet be rested for the meeting with Steve McClaren’s side, Flores has moved to deny all speculation linking the pair with a January departure.“I think it’s completely impossible,” the Spaniard said when asked if there was any possibility either player would be sold. “Our target like a team is very clear. The confidence of these players is amazing. They are completely confident in themselves.Deeney calls for more teamwork from Odion Ighalo.“They are not in a hurry or a rush to leave Watford. They’re happy at Watford. It’s important to value these kinds of things – how important it is to be happy in a place.”Deeney, 27, signed a new deal with the club in the summer after leading them to promotion. He has stated he will remain and has no intention of leaving while Ighalo, who has scored 14 league goals so far this campaign, is likely to have caught the eye of several clubs with his form.While insisting that neither striker will be sold in January, Flores did admit they may look to move on in the summer. “It’s something you need to accept,” he said.“When? I don’t know. It’s possible someday you’ll lose these players. They have confidence with the club for this year, I’m sure they want to achieve the objectives of the club with this team. After that, it’s football and anything is possible.“It is realistic to think that Ighalo, Deeney or Étienne Capoue are playing really well and will get offers – it is normal. The players can decide what they want for their life, that is important.”Ighalo has been capped seven times by Nigeria but Deeney has yet to be called up into the senior England set-up.Flores believes the former Walsall man is good enough for Roy Hodgson’s squad and is proving that at Watford.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Emmanuel Adebayor is without a club since leaving Spurs. Photograph: Dougie Allward/JMP/REXHe said: “Maybe the next step for Deeney is not thinking about going out to another team, the next step for him should be to look at the national team. Why not?“The case of Jamie Vardy at Leicester. He has got into the national team because finally the coach values the performance and quality of the players.”One name long linked with Watford has been former Tottenham striker Emmanuel Adebayor, who is without a club. While Flores admits he has looked at Adebayor and talks have taken place, he has expressed reservations over the 31-year-old Togolese player.When asked if Watford were no longer interested in signing Adebayor, Flores said: “It is not true. We haven’t taken the decision because until the last moment we will try to be right that the player is the player we need.“Not just the player but the characteristics of the player because he is an amazing player but the characteristics of Adebayor, is it the necessities of the team?“We need to check everything because we don’t want players who expect to play every single day, every single match. We can’t give that kind of circumstances to the players – I don’t know if it is possible to solve in the next few days.”

Everton have confirmed the signing of Switzerland Under-21 international Shani Tarashaj from Grasshoppers Zurich for an undisclosed fee believed to be around £3m.A statement on the club’s website on Thursday revealed that the 20-year-old has signed a four-and-a-half year deal but will immediately be loaned back to Grasshoppers to complete his national service.Muhamed Besic, the cultured scrapper who could turn out to be an Everton gem Read more“Shani is an enormous young talent in Swiss football who, without a doubt, will have a great future,” said the Everton manager, Roberto Martínez.“We’re delighted to have found a young player who believes that our club is the perfect step for him to enhance his quality and to grow his career.“He fits in really well to our style and the way we want to play the game. He is a family boy, hungry and he is desperate to fight for his place in our talented young squad.“I’m delighted we have been able to act quickly and secure the deal for Shani which means that, due to his national service commitments, he will be able to be part of our first team squad from next season. Grasshopper have been very professional and the deal has been conducted in an exemplary way.”Tarashaj, who has scored eight goals in 18 games for Grasshoppers this season, added: “It is a dream for me to sign here at Everton. I am proud and so happy to be here.”

Liverpool blow as Coutinho out for rest of month and Lovren for 10 days
~~AUTHOR~~
Andy Hunter
~CONTENTS~
Philippe Coutinho will be sidelined at least until the end of this month and Dejan Lovren for the next 10 days with hamstring injuries sustained against Stoke City, Liverpool’s manager, Jürgen Klopp, has confirmed.Bonkers? Mad? Why Van Gaal and Klopp must be taken seriously | Barney Ronay Read moreThe pair joined Liverpool’s extensive injury list in the first half of Tuesday’s Capital One Cup semi-final win at the Britannia Stadium and, in keeping with Klopp’s dire injury situation, will miss the FA Cup third-round trip to Exeter City on Friday plus next week’s Premier League matches against Arsenal and Manchester United. Kolo Touré will also be absent against Exeter having suffered cramp late on against Stoke, bringing to 12 the number of players out through injury.Coutinho’s hamstring problem is the more severe and the Brazil international could be out until in early February.Klopp said: “Phil is more serious than Dejan and Kolo but none of the three players will be available tomorrow. With muscle injuries you don’t know.“Kolo was cramp but after three days you can’t play the next game. Dejan will be available after Man United. Phil may need two to three weeks longer. It’s rare it’s quicker, sometimes it’s longer.”Liverpool are scouring the transfer market for a central defender – with Touré, Lovren, Martin Skrtel and Mamadou Sakho in the treatment room – and have Sheyi Ojo, Tiago Ilori and Ryan Kent back from loan spells at Wolverhampton Wanderers, Aston Villa and Coventry City respectively as they look for numbers for the FA Cup trip. The returning three could feature against Exeter.“We have thought about nothing else for the last few days,” said the Liverpool manager. “It is important we take our players back. These are our players and we have a situation. It is something we need to look at in the summer – the best talents should be in their club so they can develop.“Of course we have to react to the situation and not only to take new players. It is difficult to find quality players who are available now. Sometimes they are in difficult positions at their clubs or it is a question of money. It is not easy. Our eyes are open and we are watching the market.”Connor Randall, Brad Smith and Cameron Brannagan are among the young players expected to travel to Exeter, with Klopp admitting before training on Thursday that he does not know the options he has available.He added: “I will be there for sure, and will take a few players with me. I have to make the right decision for Liverpool and for my team. I have to make changes but at the moment I don’t know who is available.“The team that plays tomorrow will want to win 100% but it is true that it won’t be a team that has played together often. It is a chance for Exeter and they have to take it – that’s football. Our squad is big with all the young players and we have to use this quality now. It is a big chance for the boys but there is no pressure, they are still young.”Klopp refused to be drawn into a tit-for-tat row with Sam Allardyce over the Sunderland manager’s claim that the high-intensity pressing game demanded by the former Borussia Dortmund coach is responsible for the glut of injuries. “I’m just glad a manager of his experience has time to talk about Liverpool’s problems,” he retorted.

Umar and Cassano provide latest subplots in thrilling Serie A drama
~~AUTHOR~~
Paolo Bandini
~CONTENTS~
Now then, where were we? Ah yes, the most unpredictable start to a Serie A season in a decade or more. Two-and-a-half weeks removed from the last round of matches, fans with shorter attention spans might have yearned for a “previously on …” voiceover to refresh them on such improbable plot twists as a former bank manager leading a title challenge in Naples and Inter rising from eighth-place finishers in May to league leaders at the start of a new year.In the end, though, such a recap sequence might have felt superfluous. Serie A’s teams were about to provide us with a live action reminder of this season’s biggest storylines so far.Sinisa Mihajlovic under threat after Milan’s home defeat to Bologna Read moreInter did their part by beating Empoli 1-0, the same scoreline by which they have prevailed on eight other occasions already in this campaign. Napoli won, too, their spectacular opening goal against Torino encapsulating the conviction that Maurizio Sarri has instilled. Likewise, Fiorentina maintained their surprising Scudetto push with yet another Josip Ilicic-inspired triumph. A return of 38 points from 18 games makes this is the Viola’s joint-best start to a top-flight season since the introduction of three points for a win.Juventus continued their relentless recovery from a shabby start, winning an eighth consecutive league game. Roma scored three times away to Chievo but left with only a point, demonstrating in 90 minutes both the flair and frailty that have made them so frustrating under Rudi García. And who else could open the Giallorossi’s goalscoring account for 2016 but Sadiq Umar, the same player who had closed it at the end of 2015?Wait, Sadiq who?Never mind, we’ll come back to that. For now let’s wind our way back to where this round of fixtures began: with the derby della Lanterna on Tuesday night. Fireworks were expected between Genoa and Sampdoria, and delivered in the most literal sense by those fans who lobbed flares onto the pitch as the game began. Play had to be suspended for four minutes before it was deemed safe to resume.Juventus overpower Verona to record eighth straight Serie A victory Read moreWhen the smoke finally cleared, it gave way to one of the most entertaining matches of the season. Both teams arrived at the Marassi desperate for a win - less for the sake of local bragging rights than because their seasons demanded it. Genoa had lost four straight in the league and were sliding perilously close to the relegation zone. Samp had beaten Palermo in their final game of 2015, but prior to that were eight games without a win in all competitions.The Blucerchiati seized early control. For the second game running, Vincenzo Montella had named Antonio Cassano in his starting XI, and for the second game running, he was rewarded. Playing as a false nine, the forward was involved in every one of Samp’s goals as they raced out to a 3-0 lead.The first showcased Cassano’s vision. Receiving the ball with his back to goal in the middle of Genoa’s half, he played it first-time towards the area and Roberto Soriano. The pass should really have been cut out by Nicolás Burdisso - who had read the intention well - but instead looped up off the defender’s leg and fell perfectly for Soriano to crash home.It was a similar story for Samp’s third goal, Cassano teeing up Soriano with another assist on the half-turn that took a helpful bounce off an opponent. Eder had extended Sampdoria’s lead in-between, with a precise finish from the edge of the box. This time the crucial deflection had come off Cassano himself, as he blocked an attempted clearance into his team-mate’s path.You could award Cassano the assist on every one of those goals, or none of them, depending how generous you felt, but nobody could doubt that he had played a defining role. Perhaps most impressive was the way that he chased and fought for every ball. Sampdoria’s coaches say that he has lost 10kg since joining them in the summer, a trend that extended through the Christmas break.“During the holidays I started running and I lost a kilo,” said Cassano. “If you want to achieve certain objectives you need to sacrifice yourself. I understood that at 33 years old. Maybe it would have been better if I had worked it out at 20, but this way is OK, too.”By the time he was withdrawn, with a quarter of an hour left to play, he looked spent, but he had more than justified his inclusion. Sampdoria became noticeably worse at retaining possession without him.Genoa had already claimed one goal back before Cassano’s substitution, and should really have had two. Leonardo Pavoletti’s 69th minute header was followed-up 60 seconds later with a golden opportunity for Darko Lazovic, who missed the target when one-on-one with Emiliano Viviano.But this game still got its grandstand finish. Pavoletti has been a rare bright spark for Genoa lately and he secured a second goal through a combination of technique and sheer force of will. He took a fine touch to guide Tomás Rincón’s pass away from his marker and then another to flick the ball over Viviano before bulldozing past Niklas Moisander to head it across the line.In the minutes that remained, Viviano was forced to make a full-length save from Serge Gakpe and scramble away a cross that took a wicked goalward deflection off Ervin Zukanovic. Sampdoria did hit the bar through Edgar Barreto on the counter, but by the end they looked relieved to have held on.Relieved, and more than a little grateful to Cassano. A headline in the Italian daily, Corriere della Sera, defined him as “the last fuoriclasse”, and while that might be overstating the case it is true that he remains one of a kind. Invited to respond to the critics who had dismissed him as a spent force, Cassano replied that such people “do not understand football. I am second to nobody.”Torino work with their fans to resurrect their old home and honour their greats Read moreHe hinted that he has not yet given up hope of being selected to represent Italy at Euro 2016. That dream will be dashed, but if it is the motivation he needed for a late career flourish then we should all be grateful. His renaissance, and that of Sampdoria, has the potential to become yet another compelling sub-plot to this richest of seasons.And so too does the emergence of Umar at Roma (told you we’d get back to him). Eighteen years old and only promoted from the youth team at the end of last year, his two goals in 118 Serie A minutes are only one fewer than Edin Dzeko has managed in 1,172. He should really have scored more than once against Chievo, hitting the post when clean through, but the fact that he is putting himself in such positions is encouraging.Physically imposing at close to 6ft 4ins and capable of covering a lot of ground with those long strides, he is an intriguing athlete but his instinct for finding the gaps in defences marks him out as something more. Not by accident did he score 13 times in 10 goals for the Roma youth team prior to his promotion to the senior side.Signed on loan from Spezia in the summer, it already looks like a mere formality that Roma will take up their option to make his signing permanent in the summer for €2.5m. Whether or not García will still be the club’s manager by then remains to be seen. Right now, the Frenchman’s prospects look bleak. But after a start to the season like this one, it’s probably best not to take anything for granted.Talking points• Sinisa Mihajlovic responded to criticism of his job performance before Milan’s game against Bologna by insisting that: “The lion does not lose sleep over the opinions of the sheep”. Perhaps not, but after another muddled performance and defeat it is the perception of Silvio Berlusconi that matters most. Gazzetta dello Sport report that the owner would have sacked Mihajlovic immediately were it not for the fact that Milan have such a short turnaround before playing away to Roma on Saturday. That seems more like speculation than fact, but as we approach the midway point of this season, it is safe to assume that Berlusconi is less than thrilled to see his team 10 points adrift of the Champions League places. • What will it take for Fiorentina to sustain their title push right through to the end of this campaign? Paulo Sousa suggested that his team still needed greater depth to add resilience and versatility at key moments. No doubt he is right, and yet you could also make a case that his team is less reliant on any one individual than the other frontrunners. Fiorentina are the only team in Serie A that can boast two players (Ilicic and Nikola Kalinic) with nine goals or more, while Khouma Babacar also has a good strike rate when called upon up front. Meanwhile, Borja Valero can drop back into midfield if either of Matias Vecino or Milan Badelj are absent and Jakub Blaszczykowski (who scored on Wednesday) can fill in anywhere behind the attack as required. All this, and the potential that Giuseppe Rossi could yet come back to form (if he is not sold in this transfer window) too … • New year, same old Maurizio Zamparini. The Palermo owner told Radio Kiss Kiss on New Year’s Eve that he hoped to go through 2016 without sacking a single manager. That resolution appeared to have lasted less than a week, as he was reported to have fired Davide Ballardini immediately after the loss to Fiorentina. But then Zamparini had a disagreement with the man he wanted to bring back as manager, Beppe Iachini, over transfer policy, and decided to keep Ballardini on a little while longer after all. That should put everyone in the perfect frame of mind for Sunday’s relegation six-pointer with Verona. • Also this week: one of the first big wins for Hawkeye in Serie A. Chievo’s final equaliser against Roma came on a Simone Pepe free-kick that crashed down off the bar and just barely across the line. Play initially continued, with the Flying Donkeys trying to force home the rebound, but stopped once referee Massimiliano Irrati received the signal - via a vibrating watch - that a goal should be awarded. Confusing to watch in real-time, perhaps, but satisfying for the correct outcome in the end. Results: Chievo 3-3 Roma, Empoli 0-1 Inter, Genoa 2-3 Sampdoria, Juventus 3-0 Verona, Lazio 0-0 Carpi, Milan 0-1 Bologna, Napoli 2-1 Torino, Palermo 1-3 Fiorentina, Sassuolo 2-2 Frosinone, Udinese 2-1 Atalanta

Sadio Mané is in demand but shopping for Saints comes at a price
~~AUTHOR~~
Jacob Steinberg
~CONTENTS~
As Sadio Mané took his place in the away dugout at Carrow Road on Saturday, he would have found it worthwhile to spend a few moments reflecting on how the players who have left Southampton in the past two summers have fared since getting their dream moves. The breach of discipline that led to a furious Ronald Koeman dropping Mané for the defeat to Norwich City has inevitably set tongues wagging and Manchester United are monitoring the situation, having already inquired about the Senegalese forward’s availability last summer.Southampton’s Sadio Mané at forefront of Senegal’s golden generation | Ed Aarons Read moreIt is understandable United are interested in a player who would bring pace, directness and skill to a side who have infuriated their supporters with their prosaic play but they would be to wise to think carefully before rushing to do business with Southampton for the third time in the space of 18 months.A couple of hours before Alex Tettey condemned Southampton to a seventh defeat in their past nine matches, Liverpool lost 2-0 at West Ham United and if Nathaniel Clyne can be excused for losing out in the air to Michail Antonio and Andy Carroll for the goals, then Dejan Lovren deserves criticism for failing to respond to West Ham’s ploy of sending physically imposing attackers to pressure a small full-back. Clyne has been the best of the four players Liverpool have signed from Southampton since 2014 but the £20m they splurged on Lovren was hefty for a centre-back who regularly fails to dominate forwards. Adam Lallana started on the bench at Upton Park and the midfielder has failed to score in the league this season.There have been more misses than hits overall. Rickie Lambert plays for West Bromwich Albion now, his year at Anfield an anomaly on his CV. Morgan Schneiderlin is yet to convince fully that he belongs at United, for all his impressive shielding of their defence. Calum Chambers still has a lot to learn at Arsenal and only Luke Shaw was looking like a guaranteed success before United lost him to a broken ankle in September.It can be dangerous to assume that what works in a smaller side is instantly transferable to a less forgiving environment where off days are harder to accept.Mané and Victor Wanyama were criticised by Koeman after Southampton lost to Norwich. Wanyama was sent off for two brainless yellow cards, and Mané was dropped after turning up late for a team meeting. The indiscipline could force Southampton’s hand if there are offers for either player this month.Whereas Wanyama’s lack of poise on the ball makes him an unsuitable signing for an elite club, Mane’s case is different. He is a forward who has exposed Chelsea’s defensive deficiencies on three occasions, even when they were rock solid under José Mourinho last season. Mané is the scorer of the fastest Premier League hat-trick and there is ample time for the 23-year-old to get even better.Even so, it is still possible to have misgivings. Would Mané be restricted by Louis van Gaal’s straitjacket football? Would a new manager want him? Or is he simply too inconsistent for a club of United’s size? There have only been 13 goals in 50 Premier League appearances for Southampton and he has not scored in the league since 25 October. Mané can be electric. He can also be skittish.As commendable as it is for players to have ambition and for clubs to scour for bargains, Mané would come at a high price. Southampton are not minded to sell this month and it is likely United would have to pay £30m in the summer.Transfer window wishlists: who Premier League fans want to sign this winter Read moreIt raises questions about Old Trafford’s recruitment. If Mané is good enough to play for them now, then surely he was good enough when Southampton signed him for £11.8m from Red Bull Salzburg 18 months ago. There is a self-defeating tendency for richer clubs to ignore players at that level and let them join mid-ranking sides, only to get too excited about them on the basis of an impressive patch of form a year or two later.Paying over the odds for the flavour of the month does not enhance the taste. It often has the opposite effect, especially when not enough attention is paid to the side’s balance. Christian Benteke’s toils, since leaving Aston Villa for Liverpool, come to mind.United would be signing the best attacker from the side who are 13th and, looking at how those former Southampton players are getting on, there would be no harm in Mané continuing his development at St Mary’s.Something to think about the next time he finds himself running late.

Rémi Garde wants Arsenal’s Mathieu Debuchy to join Aston Villa
~CONTENTS~
Rémi Garde has revealed he wants to bring Mathieu Debuchy to Aston Villa and confirmed Adama Traoré is out until March. The Arsenal right-back Debuchy could to be allowed to leave this month and Garde has spoken to Arsène Wenger about the possibility of a move.Debuchy, 30, has made just seven appearances for Arsenal this season and has played only twice in the Premier League.“I had a conversation with Arsène a few days ago about some of the players and Mathieu Debuchy was among these players,” said Garde, who played under Wenger at Arsenal. “It’s too early and it won’t help me or anyone to go forward in this style to make too many more comments.”Garde refused to talk further about Loic Rémy after conceding he understood why the Chelsea manager Guus Hiddink was unhappy with his public statement of interest last week and insisted Jack Grealish will not go out on loan after being linked with Leeds.Garde has suffered another injury blow with the winger Traoré ruled out for up to 10 weeks with a broken foot after he limped off in last week’s 3-1 defeat at Sunderland.Garde added: “It’s a big blow, not more, not less, than every other player. When you lose a player for 10 weeks it is huge. I wouldn’t underestimate what he can give to the team, he has a profile that can be very spectacular.”The Frenchman has also sent the defender Tiago Ilori back to Liverpool after a disappointing spell at Villa. He arrived on loan in the summer for £1m with Villa prepared to pay a further £6m to make the deal permanent if he was a success.But the 22-year-old failed to play under either Tim Sherwood or Garde and has returned to Liverpool, where the manager Jürgen Klopp is desperate for defensive reinforcements.“He has gone back. The player was not happy about his situation at this football club and not playing,” Garde said. “When I arrived he was not totally fit, I don’t know exactly what happened between August and the beginning of November. He was not always injured but he trained with me. It was my decision and he’s gone back to Liverpool.”Alan Hutton and Carlos Sánchez (both hamstring) and Gabby Agbonlahor (back) are also due to miss Villa’s FA Cup trip to Wycombe on Saturday.

~CONTENTS~
Napoli have rejected a £14.1m (€19m) bid from Swansea for Manolo Gabbiadini. The Premier League club are desperate to bolster their forward line but the Serie A side are holding out for £16m for the Italy international.Swansea are two points above the relegation zone and have scored only 17 times in 20 games, with André Ayew the top scorer with six. Bafétimbi Gomis has only one goal from his past 16 appearances.Marko Arnautovic casts doubt over Stoke future by rejecting contract offer Read moreGabbiadini, however, is no guarantee of goals, despite being an Italy international, having scored only once in the league this season. His career has stalled somewhat at Napoli after the club signed him in January 2015 for a reported fee of £9.7m from Sampdoria and Juventus, who joint-owned him.The 24-year-old made his Italy debut against England in August 2012 and has played six times for the national team, scoring once. He has long been regarded as one of the most talented players in Italy but has often had to play second fiddle to José Callejón at club level with Gonzalo Higuaín an automatic choice up front.It is thought that the player would like to remain in Italy to try to secure a place in Antonio Conte’s Euro 2016 squad but he is quickly running out of time to do so while stuck on the bench at Napoli.

Javier Hernández has admitted that his spell on the bench at Manchester United did not help his development and believes he is now benefiting from a sustained run of matches for Bayer Leverkusen.Bonkers? Mad? Why Van Gaal and Klopp must be taken seriously | Barney Ronay Read moreThe Mexico international was allowed to leave Old Trafford last summer having started just 12 Premier League matches in the previous two seasons. Having spent last season on loan at Real Madrid, Hernández moved to Germany for a fee believed to be around £8m and has since established himself in the Bundesliga, scoring 19 goals in all competitions for Roger Schmidt’s side.“What I was missing in the last two or three years, it was like I was playing sometimes and then returning to the bench,” he told the Orlando Sentinel. “But now that I am playing most of the game or almost all of my games here in my club, that’s what I need.“Because people sometimes think the confidence is with goals, but I don’t think like that. I think confidence is to play day-by-day, to get rhythm.”Currently fifth in the table, Leverkusen resume after the winter break against Hoffenheim on Saturday.

A brief guide to … the FA Cup third round, where even the minnows have their day
~~AUTHOR~~
Scott Murray
~CONTENTS~
With the Guardian’s unstoppable rise to global dominance* we at Guardian US thought we’d run a series of articles for fans wishing to improve their knowledge of the sports history and storylines, hopefully in a way that doesn’t patronise you to within an inch of your life. A warning: If you’re the kind of person that finds The Blizzard too populist this may not be the series for you.* Actual dominance may not be global. Or dominantField Notes has already taken a look at the FA Cup final, the nearest English soccer gets to a quintessentially American-sized, MGM-musical-proportioned production like the Super Bowl. That storied match is, like the annual denouement of the NFL, a glamorous celebration of skill, success and top-level sporting achievement. But the other traditionally revered stage of the FA Cup – the famous old competition’s third round – is a rather more quaint affair, predicated instead on the stereotypically English concepts of amateurism, failure and rank ineptitude.A brief history of ... the rise and fall of the FA Cup, England's Super Bowl Read moreIt’s marvellous.To cover the basics first. The FA Cup is a knockout cup competition open to all teams in the top 10 levels of the English game, from professional behemoths like Manchester United to amateur concerns such as Billingham Synthonia, a Teesside club named after a fertiliser manufactured by local chemical concern ICI, but let’s not veer too wildly off piste here.Over 700 teams enter, and everyone outside the Premier League and the three divisions of the Football League are required to go through qualifying rounds to earn a place in the First Round proper. In that first round, 32 qualifiers join the 48 clubs from League One and League Two. After the second round, the field has been whittled down to 20, and here’s when the big boys – the 44 clubs in the Premier League and Championship – enter the draw.So it’s theoretically possible for the aforementioned Synthonia, of the Northern Football League Division Two, to draw the aforementioned United in the third round. If they make it that far. There, in a nutshell, is the third round’s unique charm. Not that this has happened this year: Synthonia were knocked out of the very first qualifying round – the extra preliminary round – way back in August, drawing 0-0 at home to nearby Consett AFC, then losing the replay 8-0. United are instead playing host to Sheffield United of League One. But, y’know, in theory. Perhaps one day.Shocks are the lifeblood – indeed, the whole point – of the third round. The greatest act of giant-killing occurred way back in January 1933. Arsenal, under the legendary Herbert Chapman, were the best team in the land by far. They were top of the First Division, on their way to the league title, and in that competition had already beaten Sunderland 6-1, Wolverhampton Wanderers 7-1, Leicester City 8-2 and Sheffield United 9-2. Their opponents in the third round of the FA Cup were Walsall, sitting10th in the old Third Division (North). “It will be the joke of the day if the league leaders are beaten,” opined this newspaper of Arsenal’s visit to the Midlands.Ho ho ho! Arsenal were under-strength, Chapman having decided to rest stars Eddie Hapgood and Joe Hulme. But not that under-strength: their team still boasted George Male, David Jack, Alex James and Cliff Bastin. “A handsome assembly saw the London team attempting to play class football against a side using typical cup-tie tactics – with the inevitable result,” reported the Observer. Walsall striker Gilbert Alsop headed the opener after an hour, beating reserve left-back Tommy Black to the ball. Black then thuggishly cut off Alsop at the knee, a foul resulting in several players having a square go at each other, as well as a penalty. Billy Sheppard converted, and on the final whistle an 11,000-strong crowd chaired their heroes off the pitch. A livid Chapman, his bowler hat hovering in mid-air over his head, suspended by the steam blasting out of his lugs, told Black he would never play for Arsenal again. He was transferred to Plymouth Argyle within the week.Fifty-nine years later, Arsenal were reigning league champions when they visited Wrexham in the third round of the cup. The Welsh side had finished the previous season bottom of the Fourth. So you already know how this one ended. Alan Smith put the Gunners ahead shortly before half time, but Wales veteran and former Manchester United dynamo Mickey Thomas scored from a free kick on 82 minutes, setting up 20-year-old Steve Watkin to snatch a jaw-dropping winner a couple of minutes after. First beaten by 92nd, and yet Walsall remains the greatest FA Cup third-round shock of all. Hey, we don’t write the rules.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Mark Robins’s goal against Forest in 1990: did it save Fergie’s job? Photograph: Bob Thomas/Getty ImagesThe third round has changed the course of history at our big clubs once or twice. Manchester United striker Mark Robins scored a winner at Nottingham Forest in January 1990, a goal which went down in folklore (rightly or wrongly) as saving the skin of struggling United manager Alex Ferguson. United went on to win the cup that year, and the subsequent flurry of honours represents a sizable chunk of every statistic-obsessed child’s Football Yearbook.That wasn’t exactly a shock, though, unlike Worcester City’s 2-1 defeat of Liverpool in 1959. The Southern League North West club’s victory, over a team containing Jimmy Melia, Ronnie Moran and England 1958 World Cup striker Alan A’Court, effectively ended the reign of Liverpool manager Phil Taylor. Enter Bill Shankly. The subsequent flurry of honours represents, et cetera, and so on, and so forth.Cardiff City of the third tier put out Premier League leaders Leeds United in 2002, shattering the confidence of David O’Leary’s side to such an extent that they didn’t win again in any competition for another 10 games. They finished the season in fifth place, 21 points behind eventual champs Arsenal, all belief in the Peter Ridsdale Project evaporated. Within two seasons they were down, fallen off the financial knife-edge, and haven’t been back to the top flight since.Mind you, while down in the third tier, Leeds did put out bitter rivals Manchester United in the 2009-10 FA Cup at Old Trafford, Jermaine Beckford scoring the only goal of Fergie’s only third-round defeat. Every cloud, no matter how large and bleak, has a shiny rim.But a Leeds victory over Manchester United, regardless of what division the two clubs live in at the time, is only going to register so much on the official FA Cup shock-o-meter. The true romance of the third round is always found in those clashes between the non-league clubs and the big boys. This year, only one non-league club has reached the third round: Hampshire minnows Eastleigh of the National League (the division directly below League Two). Eastleigh will host Bolton Wanderers at their Ten Acres ground. With Bolton struggling at the bottom of the Championship, but with four cup wins on their roll of honour, it’s a classic David versus Goliath slaying in the making. It should be live on British television. BBC and BT Sport, shame, shame, shame.Luton Town were the last non-league side to beat a top-flight club, seeing off Norwich City at Carrow Road in the 2012-13 fourth round. Before that, we go back to 1989, when Sutton United put out Coventry City 2-1 in the 1988-89 third round. Coventry, a top-flight side back then, had won the cup just two years earlier, but didn’t follow up their first major trophy with further success: in 1988 they went out in the fourth round as defending champions to an awful Watford side, suffered this abject humiliation by Sutton a year later, and in 1990 went out again in the third round at Fourth Division Northampton Town.Woking – a commuter town near London and the setting for HG Wells’ War of the Worlds – provided another fantastical tale in the 1991 FA Cup. The town’s team dumped Second Division side West Bromwich Albion – cup winners in 1888, 1892, 1931, 1954 and 1968 – out of the third round, a 4-2 thrashing at the Hawthorns, Tim Buzaglo their hat-trick hero and the most famous footballer in the land for 15 minutes. The chances? A million to one. Woking went on to bravely lose by a single goal in the fourth round at Everton, another notable result. Sutton, by comparison, followed up their 1989 win over Coventry by getting spanked 8-0 at Norwich. Lightning rarely strikes twice.And then there was Hereford United. Their 1972 victory over Newcastle United wasn’t quite as big a shock in pure footballing terms as Walsall’s 1933 win against Arsenal: Newcastle, while a decent side, simply weren’t anywhere near the level of Chapman’s men. But it was non-league versus First Division, and it’s probably more famous these days, what with being on colour television and all that. The drama it provided wasn’t half bad, either.If you want a picture of English football in the 1970s, this is the one: a quagmire of a pitch, kids in green parkas hanging out of nearby trees to catch a free peek, everything saturated in a washed-out beige. Hereford had taken a shock 17-second lead in the original tie at St James Park, and scrapped to secure a 2-2 draw. Newcastle were still expected to win the replay at the Southern League club’s Edgar Street ground, what with being mid-table in the First Division and having won the Fairs Cup (now the Europa League) only three years earlier. But no.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Ronnie Radford, resplendent in his too-short jersey, celebrates Hereford’s victory over Newcastle in 1972. Photograph: Not known/PopperfotoNewcastle and England striker Malcolm McDonald looked to have settled matters with a goal eight minutes from time, but Ronnie Radford equalised with a ludicrous long-range screamer from the mud three minutes later, and Ricky George sealed it in extra time. Radford’s goal – click here, again and again and again – is unquestionably the most memorable in third-round history. In the early 1980s, the BBC produced a series of five-minute programmes called 100 Great Sporting Moments, culled from five decades’ worth of archive. Along with Gareth Edwards’ try for the Barbarians against the All Blacks in 1973, the Hereford-Newcastle clip was the one that plugged gaps in the BBC schedules the most often.So here’s a thing: Walsall 1933, Hereford 1972 … the truly epochal third-round wins come along roughly every 40 years. We’re due another. Eastleigh, Exeter City, Scunthorpe United: how about giving us something very special to remember?

West Ham’s Slaven Bilic rules out selling Andy Carroll this month
~CONTENTS~
The West Ham manager, Slaven Bilic, insists Andy Carroll will not be sold this month.Sunderland and Carroll’s former club Newcastle have been linked with moves for the 27-year-old striker, amid reports the Hammers were considering cashing in on a player with a bad injury record.Andy Carroll comes good but Slaven Bilic warns him now is time to deliver Read moreBut Bilic says he has no intention of getting rid of Carroll, who has looked back to his best recently and scored two goals in his last two matches.“The club are not willing to listen to offers,” Bilic said. “We want Andy to stay and perform like he does in most games.“Nobody at the club wants to sell him, he’s a very good player. But whenever he scores a couple of goals the rumours start.“The only way he can stop the rumours is to play badly, which we don’t want him to do. We don’t want to sell him. He’s very good in the dressing room and I know he’s happy here.”Bilic also reported positive fitness news regarding the midfielder Manuel Lanzini.It was feared the Argentinian would be sidelined for up to six weeks with the thigh injury he suffered against Liverpool last Saturday, but Bilic said: “He’s working hard on his recovery and hopefully he will be back in two or three weeks.”Victor Moses will not be fit for Saturday’s FA Cup tie at home to Wolves, but is due back in full training next week, while the striker Diafra Sakho could be back at the beginning of February following a thigh injury.

Sinisa Mihajlovic under threat after Milan’s home defeat to Bologna

~CONTENTS~
Sinisa Mihajlovic has said he “will not give up” after his job became increasingly perilous following Milan’s home defeat to Bologna on Wednesday night.After a late Emanuele Giaccherini goal brought a 1-0 defeat for the Rossoneri at San Siro the embattled coach insisted: “We must continue working and try to improve things calmly. Today we made too many mistakes and at the end you risk losing, as we did. It is a defeat that hurts because we create so much and score so few goals. The lads always tried to win.”Juventus overpower Verona to record eighth straight Serie A victory Read moreMilan are halfway through yet another disappointing season for the side who once blazed a trail through Europe. They have won just eight games, drawn four and lost six in Serie A and lie seventh in the table with Mihajlovic, Milan’s fourth coach in less than two years following Filippo Inzaghi, Massimiliano Allegri and Clarence Seedorf, seemingly unable to stop the rot.Since winning Serie A in 2011, Milan have finished second, third, eighth and 10th and are in danger of failing to qualify for Europe for a third consecutive season.“The fans jeered us and I understand that, they have every right to jeer. I will not give up. We lost, but we played our game and had five clear-cut opportunities clear on goal. When you don’t take those chances, you risk paying for it,” Mihajlovic said.The Milan chief executive Adriano Galliani was spotted on the phone with the president Silvio Berlusconi but Mihajlovic said he had yet to have any feedback from the pair. “We haven’t spoken yet. Milan’s objective this season is to earn a place in the Champions League and try to win the Coppa Italia.”Milan visit Roma on Saturday evening followed by a Coppa Italia quarter-final against Carpi next week which may be the last chance Mihajlovic has of saving his job.Mihajlovic was appointed on a two-year-deal in June on a reported salary of £1.9m a year after the former striker Inzaghi was sacked following a year in charge.The former Milan manager Carlo Ancelotti, who had recently been sacked by Real Madrid, had rejected offers to return to the Rossoneri and is no longer an option, having agreed to take over at Bayern Munich this summer.

Bonkers? Mad? Why Van Gaal and Klopp must be taken seriously
~~AUTHOR~~
Barney Ronay
~CONTENTS~
It took a while. But here we are at last. Not only is Louis van Gaal in retreat at Manchester United, it seems the nature of his ultimate departure – which always seemed likely to centre on his otherness, his intellectualism, his notebook – has also been settled. Studying the gleefully outraged coverage of Van Gaal’s struggles with his stuttering team you half expect to flick on the rolling sports news and discover United’s manager has been found wandering around Salford in a Napoleonic hat demanding the immediate return of Giza and the pyramids to the Greater French Empire.As Van Gaal himself has no doubt noted, there is a particular tone and texture to managerial failure in the Premier League. Or at least, there is when it comes to managers who make the mistake of being academic, methodical and foreign. “Arsène who?” was the famous headline over coverage of the risible French nobody’s unveiling as successor to Bruce Rioch. And for all the thrilling cosmopolitanism of the Premier League it is a skein of native insularity that remains.Manchester United playing an unconventional man-management game | Paul Wilson Read moreThis is not to excuse the current team. Clearly Van Gaal’s United are a disappointment. The style of play is stodgy. Some of the signings look substandard. Whole areas of the team are worryingly undermanned. The Champions League exit was a genuine, perhaps decisive point of failure. Perhaps some steadiness and another top-four finish is the limit of what an aged Van Gaal, in his final job, was ever likely to achieve at this transitional United.More interesting, and indeed more significant for the wider culture of English football, is the way this failure is interpreted. Managers such as Van Gaal do not just fail, or make mistakes here. They’re exposed, unmanned, rendered mad, bonkers. With Van Gaal we’re already into the Loopy Louis stuff. References to his dossiers (briefcase wanker!), his refusal to stand up and shout at his players are now dropped in, rather sadly, as a matter of course.A particular photo of Van Gaal (who is 66 and in good shape) looking frighteningly bemused and unkempt has already become a kind of hostility-signifier above the latest pitying editorial. This week even a minor point about United’s manager wanting to meet his players’ parents to assess how they might age (which coaches in football, cricket and basketball all do) was portrayed as a hilarious eccentricity. Here he comes now. Bonkers Louis, with his words. And his notebook. And his hair. And his trying to understand things. And while we’re at it, here comes Mad Jürg too, Liverpool’s manager who has in the space of few short weeks gone from charming, ultramodern antidote to Brendan Rodgers, to “still learning about the Premier League” to the first few snuffles and sniffs and shivers of crazed foreign failure.In Van Gaal’s case it is not hard, at a stretch, to offer an apologia for his current constipated United. The Van Gaal way has always been to keep a structured sense of position. Attacking players stay wide as much as they dare. The game is stretched. You wait for the opponent to blink, trust your players on the ball. It has worked at times. Against Liverpool at Anfield in March United scored two brilliant goals borne out of swift diagonal passes to players who held their positions and created space.The problem is the works have gummed a little now. Premier League players grown, or nurtured or recruited to follow orders and chase the ball are standing still, unable to perform with both the discipline and guile in attacking areas required to make the system work.Wayne Rooney, they say, has gone backwards, an “instinctive” player overburdened with tactical instruction. Which is of course Rooney’s own failing, and a familiar English sticking point. Similarly Van Gaal has always liked young players because they are more receptive, keener to take on board new ideas. Welcome to England, Louis, land of the barrack-room hierarchy where the ability to think on your feet and read the game has always suffered in the face of a more robust, less academic culture. A 45-year-old Van Gaal might have been able to wring this out of his team. The pensionable version has presided over a sullen, lateral stasis.There is no need to make these excuses though. Whatever the structural reasons, no matter how outdated that prototype possession game may have become, compared to the more varied tactical experiments elsewhere in Europe, Van Gaal has simply failed in the normal way: a routine, everyday, entirely explicable kind of failure, borne out of the usual bad decisions, injuries, bad luck, poor judgment, poor timing.And yet so much of the analysis remains unhelpfully hysterical and ad hominem, tinged with triumphalism at the sight of the venerable old European master brought low, testament to the indomitable strength of English football, its physical challenge, its notebook-free sense of basic human decency and so on.The paradox here is that Van Gaal still represents, in method if not outcome, so many things English football has traditionally neglected. And about which it should still be eager to learn: things like coaching and development, the willingness to theorise and develop a football borne out of ideas as much as sweat and inspiration. Van Gaal will remain a managerial great, no matter how energetically he is jeered from the Premier League. What we do with him, what English football can learn even in failure, is the more interesting point.For a start it is worth noting the nature of the job Van Gaal is being asked to do at United. The requirements are clear. A title-challenging team. Last 16 in Europe. Thrilling style of play. All within the space of 18 months. Plus in England this means not just improving, or bolting on some finishing touches, but pulling an entire team out of the air from one to 11.The Question: what is attacking football? | Jonathan Wilson Read moreTwo domestic cup competitions, no winter break and no easy games is one thing. The requirement to produce a team from scratch in the middle of it is something else. Luis Enrique could mould his Champions League winning Barcelona around six players – four home grown career Nou Campers – who won the competition in 2011. Of United’s team that day only Rooney, Michael Carrick and Antonio Valencia remain.Van Gaal is accused of spending badly, a mortal Premier League sin. But spending is not really his game. Development, improvement, integration: these are his skills. Instead he’s being asked to disco dance. Still, Anthony Martial, Morgan Schneiderlin, Luke Shaw, Ander Herrera, Matteo Darmian and Daley Blind all look decent enough buys in isolation. But not all at once, not without a spine to cling to. As we hear so often, Van Gaal has spent £250m. But you can be pretty sure he’d prefer to do this another way.Similarly Klopp, who took three settled years to create his thrillingly disciplined Borussia Dortmund team, is struggling to untangle the threads of a squad acquired by three different managers, under different conditions, to entirely different coaching and tactical ends. In the last five years Liverpool have signed 50 players, almost a team a year. In Alex Ferguson’s last season United lost Paul Pogba for nothing and bought five players for £53m who have all since left the club. To stutter in these circumstances, to be still sifting and sorting 18 months on is less a sign of loopiness and over-theorising, more evidence of how frantic elite level English football has become.Perhaps it might even be time to acknowledge – and here’s a thought – that sacking your manager might just be the problem here not the solution. Getting rid of Van Gaal may even be the best option right now. But it also creates another set of problems, propagates its own failure, offers the next man the same set of pitfalls.This is not just a Premier League fixation. At Real Madrid Zinedine Zidane has now followed Rafa Benítez, who followed Carlo Ancelotti, who followed José Mourinho, who followed Manuel Pellegrini: different styles, different tactics, different training methods. The result is emerging talents get lost, tenderly nurtured careers come to an abrupt halt . Even star players – witness Gareth Bale’s tentative reflowering in recent weeks – need to start again.Some can cope with this challenge. André Villas-Boas never stopped paddling in his 256 days at Chelsea. Mauricio Pochettino, who never complains, who has a clear set of methods, who takes the tools he has and polishes them vigorously, has flourished at two relatively sensible English clubs.Otherwise patience is key. Van Gaal took three years to win his first league title at Ajax, and four to win the champions league. It took Klopp three years to finish above fifth place in the Bundesliga. Then came ignition and two league titles built around a team that had grown together. In these circumstances failure, friction, stuttering methods become part of the game, an object of interest, even losing a part of the wider groping towards sustained success.Mad Jürgen will get plenty of time. Those who fit his system will self-select in the current squad. Others will be added selectively. A team will emerge. Klopp is too much of a star at Liverpool to be hurried. Not so Mad Louis, for whom the end will most likely come sooner than planned, with the suspicion, even in the thrill of ground zero fresh starts, that United will still be burning the throttle in first gear, still trying to pull success out of the air.

Barcelona reject accusations Luis Suárez threatened Espanyol players in tunnel
~~AUTHOR~~
Guardian sport
~CONTENTS~
Luis Enrique has dismissed reports that striker Luis Suárez threatened Espanyol players in the tunnel after Barcelona’s 4-1 Copa del Rey victory at Camp Nou on Wednesday.Espanyol finished the first leg of the last-16 tie with nine men after Hernán Pérez and Papakouly Diop were sent off, while there were accusations that goalkeeper Pau López stamped on Lionel Messi.But with ill-feeling still hanging over from the 0-0 draw between the city rivals at the weekend when Barça players accused opposition fans of racially abusing Neymar, it was Suárez’s clash with Diop that caused problems after the final whistle.The Question: what is attacking football? | Jonathan Wilson Read moreAccording to referee Juan Martínez Munuera’s report, which has been quoted by Catalan newspaper Sport, the Senegal international told Suárez, “I shit in your whore mother”, and was shown a red card in the 75th minute.“At the end of the game, once in the tunnel, Barça’s No9, Suárez while the Espanyol players were coming up the stairs, waited for them and shouted at them on various occasions,” read the report. “He said: ‘I’m waiting for you, come here! You’re a waste of space’. It provoked a confrontation between players of both clubs and the security guards had to get involved, as did coaches of both teams.”Asked about the incident, Luis Enrique dismissed the accusation as “Christmas carols”, presumably in reference to the fact the match was being played on Dia de Los Reyes (Three Kings Day). “It isn’t down to the coaches or the players to keep the peace,” the Barcelona manager added. “It’s down to the referees to ensure we play football and not American football. There was some tension. I’d like it if there were more football, fewer interruptions and no injuries.“When someone oversteps the mark, it’s down to the referees to keep order. Of course there’s tension in these games. The players know each other, they’re two teams with a special rivalry but that rivalry has to remain positive.”But Diop, who launched into a dance routine in May 2014 when playing for Levante in response to racist chanting from Atlético Madrid fans, insisted Suárez should have been sent off as well.“We both insulted each other. He said swear words to me, and me to him, and I get sent off. The referee told me he didn’t hear us both, only me,” Diop told Carrusel Deportivo.“[The press] have spent all week saying we are violent and this has had its effect. [Barcelona’s players] are really good and if you cannot even touch them, they can do what they want.“You cannot say we were violent. There wasn’t any blood – if we had wanted to, the Barça players would have gone off on stretchers.”Espanyol received eight yellow cards and two reds during the match, although Andrés Iniesta dismissed suggestions things had gone over the top. “Violence is a very strong word, in games like this there’s a lot of rivalry and contact,” he said.

Football transfer rumours: Neven Subotic to Liverpool?
~~AUTHOR~~
Barry Glendenning
~CONTENTS~
With their players dropping like hamstrung flies and reinforcements urgently required in the heart of their defence, it’s no surprise that today’s Rumour Mill leads with talk linking Liverpool with a couple of centre-halves. “In this moment with no centre-back fit, I would say it is a situation where we have to think about going into the transfer market,” said Jürgen Klopp after losing another couple of players to injury during the Capital One Cup match against Stoke on Tuesday, so it’s no great surprise to hear talk that his trusted former Borussia Dortmund lieutenant Neven Subotic could be on his way to Anfield on loan.A Serb who was forced to spend most of his childhood in Germany and the USA, Subotic was a stalwart of Klopp’s Dortmund team at the Westfalenstadion, having followed him there from Mainz. Should talks between Dortmund and Liverpool go well, the classy 27-year-old could find himself lining up for his former manager at a third different club. Liverpool are also making enquiries about Internazionale defender Andrea Ranocchia and could also attempt to sign Joël Matip from Schalke now instead of next summer, as seems to have been their original intention. Ranocchia had also been the subject of a flirtatious come-on from Norwich, who will move for Wolfsburg central defender Timm Klose after having their advances rebuffed.Various media outlets are reporting Manchester United have failed in their attempt to sign Sadio Mané from Southampton despite their best attempts to sort out a deal. While the winger has made no secret of his desire to move on, his employers insist he is not for sale. Expect this particular dance between the two clubs to continue for another few weeks. While yesterday’s Rumour Mill suggested Newcastle were hopeful of signing Alexandre Lacazette from Lyon, today’s can reveal the Ligue 1 side accepted a £22m bid from their Premier League counterparts. Sadly for Newcastle, Mr Lacazette or his people have presumably taken a peek at the table and decided an immediate future spent mired in a relegation battle would be no future at all.In-form, top-knotastic Stoke City striker Marko Arnautovic has rejected the offer of a new and apparently not-improved-enough contract at Stoke City, who may be displeased to hear rumours Paris Saint-Germain are scouting the 26-year-old who has 18 months left on his contract at the Britannia. PSG remain strongly linked with Chelsea’s Eden Hazard, who it seems will have his pick of Europe’s elite clubs in the likely event of his departure from Stamford Bridge next summer … if not sooner.Pep Guardiola remains in charge at Bayern Munich but that hasn’t stopped The Sun publishing his Manchester City shopping list for next season: David Alaba, Gerard Piqué, Lionel Messi and Paul Pogba are just a handful of the obscure emerging talents to feature. Pep will also take the moon in a bucket but only if it happens to be blue. The moon, that is. Not the bucket.The Rumour Mill isn’t about to pretend it reads Turkish daily newspaper Sabah over breakfast, but we can reveal they happen to think Chelsea striker Loïc Rémy, already a target for Newcastle, is wanted by Galatasaray on a loan deal until the end of the season. Elsewhere in Turkey, Lig TV have reported Liverpool will sell Lazar Markovic to Fenerbahce for £7.3m once the Serbia winger’s loan deal expires at the end of the season.Stephan El Shaarawy at Bournemouth: did we ever think we’d see the day? Almost certainly not is the answer to that particular query but it just might be approaching. The 23-year-old Milan striker is enduring an unsuccessful loan spell at Monaco and Milan are listening to offers for the man they call The Pharoah. It is believed Bournemouth have offered to take El Shaarwy on loan with a view to signing him for £10m come season’s end if they avoid relegation, although the player would rather return to Italy where Roma are hopeful of securing his scrawl.On loan at Southampton from QPR, Steven Caulker is also having a tough time of it, having started only one Premier League match for the Saints this season. With everyone concerned agreed he’s in need of a fresh start elsewhere, Crystal Palace and Bournemouth are preparing to duke it out in the hope of winning his affection. That’s Crystal Palace who have already had £15m worth of overtures for Sporting’s Algerian striker Islam Slimani firmly rejected. And finally, out-of-favour Spurs winger Andros Townsend is the subject of interest from West Brom and Watford, while Norwich aren’t prepared to let Nathan Redmond leave for Crystal Palace, who seem determined to hog this paragraph, for a penny less than £15m.

Former Ireland international Andy Keogh on verge of Perth Glory return
~CONTENTS~
Former Ireland international Andy Keogh could make his A-League return this weekend after Perth Glory finally parted ways with import Guyon Fernandez.Andy Keogh re-signs for Perth Glory but may not play this season Read moreKeogh has been training with Glory since late last year after returning from a short playing stint in Thailand.The 29-year-old starred in the A-League last season with 12 goals, and Glory have been trying to get him back out on the park to boost their ailing finals hopes.But their bid to sign him as a guest player was knocked back by FFA, meaning Perth needed to part with one of their current imports in order to place Keogh on their main list.Fernandez always loomed as the man most in danger of being cut because of ongoing foot and hamstring issues.The 29-year-old Dutchman had not played since 15 November, and he officially left the club on Thursday by mutual consent.Last month, Keogh signed on with Perth for the 2016/17 and 2017/18 A-League seasons.Perth Glory make formal response to FFA allegations of salary cap breach Read moreHe will be available to play against Adelaide United at nib Stadium on Saturday – and the remainder of the current season – pending an international transfer clearance.If the clearance comes in time, Keogh’s inclusion will be a massive boost for a team that has struggled to score.Glory have scored just 14 goals in 13 games this season, with Kenny Lowe’s charges sitting in ninth spot.But with just three points separating Glory from the top six, there’s still plenty of scope for the team to push for a finals berth.Glory are also chasing the signature of Socceroos striker Adam Taggart in a bid to further bolster their attacking firepower.Police charges dropped against Perth Glory duo Andy Keogh and Josh Risdon Read moreKeogh departed Glory at the end of last season in the wake of the club’s salary cap saga.They were stripped of their spot in the finals and fined $269,000 after being found guilty of exceeding the salary cap by about $400,000.Keogh became a central figure in the investigation, with reports alleging he was paid around $200,000 through non-disclosed transactions to family members.His immediate family stayed in Perth while he linked up with Thai club Ratchaburi.But he cut the playing stint short in order to return to Perth.

Central Coast's Anthony Caceres in talks about move to Manchester City
~CONTENTS~
Central Coast Mariners’ playmaker Anthony Caceres could be on his way to Manchester City, with news the English Premier League giants are in advanced talks with the A-League club.Central Coast Mariners' Roy O’Donovan gets eight-game ban for headbutt Read moreCity and an unnamed J-League club have made offers for the 23-year-old, who was dropped from coach Tony Walmsley’s squad last week and appears to be on the outer at the struggling Mariners.Owner Mike Charlesworth has been discussing terms with the EPL side, who have already taken on former Brisbane star Luke Brattan this year.Caceres has a buyout clause, which cashed-up City would easily pay for.However, he does not have a European passport, having Uruguayan parents.Walmsley said he would be sad to see Caceres leave.“I didn’t know there was any public information out there until I heard that this morning,” Walmsley said on Thursday.“I do know that Mike Charlesworth has been in dialogue with the City Group. Caceres has got a transfer fee built into his contract. If Mike and the head of the City Group have come to an agreement, I’ve yet to be told that’s the case.“But if it is, what a great opportunity for Caceres to go and try and reach the potential we all think he’s got. The saddest thing was he didn’t stay around to finish his contract – if he does go – and see out his potential here and get a real big signing somewhere else.“I’m sure whatever deal is struck, Mike will be looking after the club’s best interests.”Sydney FC, Melbourne Victory and Western Sydney also expressed interest in signing the talented youngster, but Sky Blues coach Graham Arnold did not think the Mariners would be willing to let him play for a rival A-League side.A-League transfer window sees signings for Melbourne City and Victory Read more“I was asked if I’d like him, and I said ‘yes’,” said Arnold, who previously coached and developed Caceres at Central Coast.“But I don’t think the Mariners would let him come to Sydney FC somehow. I think Anthony is probably one of their most-prized assets.“Knowing Mike Charlesworth, he wants money. If they’re going to let him go anywhere, I’d say it would be for a sale. I don’t think they’d hand him over to any other A-League club.”Caceres is reportedly one of a handful of players on the outer, after several, including Nick Fitzgerald, were dropped for the New Year’s Eve 3-1 win over Wellington.So far this transfer window, the club have only made signings from the state league.They were chasing former Greek striker Georgios Samaras, but decided against it due to monetary and fitness concerns.

Jürgen Klopp to pick callow Liverpool side again for Exeter Cup replay
~~AUTHOR~~
Stuart James
~CONTENTS~
Jurgen Klopp expressed his disbelief that Liverpool have another game to play after his callow side were held to a 2-2 draw against Exeter City in the FA Cup third round and the German vowed to pick another inexperienced team for the replay at Anfield on Wednesday week.Brad Smith’s goal 17 minutes from time denied Exeter a place in the fourth round on a night when Klopp was missing 12 players through injury and gave five youngsters their debut. Tom Nichols put Exeter ahead early on and when Lee Holmes restored their advantage direct from a corner, after Jerome Sinclair had equalised for Liverpool, the League Two club were on course for a famous upset.Liverpool’s Brad Smith strikes to deny Exeter a memorable FA Cup scalp Read moreSmith’s late strike, however, earned Liverpool a draw and Exeter a significant six-figure windfall, leaving Klopp to reflect on how he will deal with an already congested fixture schedule. “I can’t believe we have to play another game now,” the Liverpool manager said.“Of course it’s difficult. We have two other games [in the Premier League] and then the replay is after Manchester United. If the situation doesn’t change we will play the same team or a little bit different with other young players. I can’t change it. So we have to try now to give the intensity to different players. We have to try it in the FA Cup and accept what happens.”Klopp felt that Liverpool deserved a draw on what was a poor playing surface. “The pitch was difficult for both teams, the first goal of Exeter was their first attack. Until then it was OK but that was ‘Oh my God’, not good for the young boys,” he said.“Their second goal was something like a miracle that the ball was in and then in an atmosphere like this and with legs getting tired … we had a few more moments but not enough. So in the end we have to respect our own situation.“We were here to go through to the next round, it wasn’t 100% – but 50% – so now we have another game at Anfield. It is what it is. It’s obvious what we have to learn in the future. We have to be more robust. It was an advantage for Exeter that they knew the pitch better than we do. But they were strong on the wing, they were quick in transition and they made a spectacular goal from the corner.”Nichols admitted he was disappointed not to have won but is now looking forward to the replay. “I thought the boys were brilliant,” he said. “I thought we thoroughly deserved a draw. We didn’t park the bus, we gave it a right go and we’ve got a trip to Anfield.”

Liverpool struggle to find right wavelength after warm Exeter reception
~~AUTHOR~~
Ben Fisher
~CONTENTS~
Exeter City began to roll out the red carpet for Jürgen Klopp’s arrival less than three hours before kick-off. A member of the ground staff hastily vacuumed the club’s media suite in the 110-year-old Stagecoach stand, which will be demolished at the end of the season. It resembled the local working men’s club more than anything possibly connected to Exeter’s fashionista manager, Paul Tisdale.“The Liverpool manager is going to be coming in here after the match to do interviews and it looks a real state at the minute,” she told the stewards soaking up the scenery before just another game. Talk soon moved on to Accrington Stanley in a couple of weeks’ time but the final touches were ready for when Klopp eventually entered, receiving a hero’s welcome from home and away support as he made his way off the team coach, with locals leaning out of the windows from the lofts of terraced properties on St James Road to witness his heavily anticipated alighting.Liverpool’s Brad Smith strikes to deny Exeter a memorable FA Cup scalp Read morePerhaps they recognised the unenviable task that was presented to the German’s side in rain-soaked Devon. Klopp, who was forced to name what resembled a reserve side because of injuries, gave debuts to three of his travelling party – Kevin Stewart, Ryan Kent and Tiago Ilori. The tarpaulin at St James Park was probably nothing new to Stewart or the teenager Kent, who had been playing in League One with Swindon and Coventry respectively this season.Without 13 first-team players because of injury, seven of whom were hamstrung, at least Klopp was able to lean on the sturdy frame of Christian Benteke, who was given the captain’s armband for the first time in a Liverpool shirt.The German decided against utilising his insurance policy, the midfield pair of Adam Lallana and Lucas Leiva, who stayed on the bench throughout.The shirts of the Liverpool starting XI looked more like lottery numbers. Despite the pre-match fanfare, burgeoning queues and selfies with just about anybody in a Liverpool tracksuit, something was missing.Liverpool’s experimental line-up rarely looked scary for the League Two defence. Benteke was estranged and comfortably contained by the Grecians defender Jordan Taylor-Moore while the holding midfielder Jordan Tillson, son of the former Bristol Rovers defender Andy, halted most of Liverpool’s flow. Kent, the winger, was subdued and unsurprisingly replaced by Pedro Chirivella. José Enrique has been starved of first-team football and it showed. Their approach was at times naive but it will be a sight Liverpool fans may have to get used to as Klopp confirmed he will field a similar side in the replay at Anfield in 11 days’ time.Despite the hospitality the Exeter manager Tisdale had urged his players to make the most of the occasion and give the visitors “a high-quality problem”.“What we do today echoes in eternity, make history” one banner spread across the entire home Kop end read.Tom Nichols, the Exeter striker, must have been taking note as he tapped home Jamie Reid’s cross to open the scoring.Nichols had free rein down the right flank and his surging run led to the corner which Lee Holmes rattled straight in just before the interval.Usually when Klopp clicks his fingers, his players react. His side thumped Southampton 6-1 after going a goal down inside 60 seconds and rescued a point against West Bromwich Albion in stoppage-time last month. Before that they came from behind to beat Bordeaux 2-1 and top their Europa League group.They replied here, first through Jerome Sinclair, the 19-year-old forward, but nothing in this performance was reminiscent of the stage shows from Klopp’s teams that fans have learned to love. The Australia international Brad Smith would level things up with 17 minutes left.The most important thing for Liverpool was to avoid picking up any more injuries a day after Jordon Ibe was ruled out with a hamstring injury, although they could have done without a replay, of course.One cannot help but feel, though, that Klopp, perhaps more than any of the 8,241 fans inside St James Park, sensed how events would unfold before the ball was even kicked. His wry smile following Smith’s equaliser was a picture that told a thousand words. There was a supreme confidence that Liverpool would not be toppled here, at a stage when so many big names have fallen in the past.Aside from the ever-growing injury list, things are perhaps not too bad for the Liverpool manager after all. His side host Arsenal and Manchester United at Anfield in the next nine days and two wins would leave them firmly in the hunt for a place in the Premier League top four come February.Klopp’s side are well-placed to reach the League Cup final and are more than capable of going the distance in the Europa League. The manager will just be hopeful Friday’s flight home to Merseyside does not involve another discussion with one of his medical staff.

Kick-offs can now go backwards, and other rule changes newly approved
~CONTENTS~
Sending players off for pre-match fights. Permitting the ball to go in any direction at kick-off. Allowing more players to be treated on the field. Stopping teams benefiting from players being punished.You are the Ref No355: Guus Hiddink Read moreThese are a few of the innovations contained in rewritten laws of the game, overhauled by football’s rule-makers in an attempt to remove inconsistencies and make them more user-friendly.A 22,000-word document has been halved to 12,000 words over the last 18 months. The new laws were approved by the International Football Association Board in London this week, will be ratified at the body’s March meeting and will be in force for the European Championships starting in June.David Elleray, who formulated the comprehensive revision of the laws, hopes rules will no longer be open to as much interpretation. “We are trying to help situations which tend to occur very often and are a bit crazy,” said Elleray, a former Premier League referee.“We have tried to use much clearer language. We tried to avoid a lot of unnecessary repetition and we tried to make it up-to-date. Because the laws have evolved piecemeal and no one has done a comprehensive review there have been inconsistencies.”Here is how the biggest revamp of the rules of football in 135 years could look, largely through Elleray’s explanations:Kick-offThe current law says the ball must go forward at kick-off and players have to be in their own half. The rule is being changed to allow the ball to go in any direction at kick-off as long as it moves.Pre-match red cardsCiting a row in the tunnel between Patrick Vieira and Roy Keane before an Arsenal-Manchester United match in 2005, Elleray highlighted how they could not have been sent off in the event of a full-scale fight. The laws were written at a time before it was customary for teams to line up next to each other in the tunnel before kick-off.In future referees will be able to punish red-card offences any time after the pre-match inspection.Elleray: “[Fighting players] would be banned from playing the match but both teams would still start with 11 because they would be able to use one of the named substitutes. They would lose a substitute.”Leaving the field after treatmentElleray: “If a player is injured from a challenge which is punished by a red or yellow card, he can have quick treatment on the field of play and does not have to leave. It always seemed unfair that the victim team was down to 10 men and the guilty team has 11 against 10.”Quick returnElleray: “If a player goes off to change his boots, at the moment he has to wait until the game is stopped and the referee has to go and check his boots before he can play again. Now we are saying his boots or whatever can be checked by the fourth official, the assistant referee even, and [the player can] come back during play.”Grabbing opponentsElleray: “Two players go off the field of play. One tries to get back on to play the ball and the other one grabs him off the field of play to stop him going back on. At the moment the referee gives a red or yellow card and restarts with a drop ball, which is clearly wrong. So we will be giving a free-kick on the touchline or the goal-line. If it is inside the penalty area, it can be a penalty kick.”Blocking goalsElleray: “If a [non-playing] substitute at the moment comes on and dives and stops the goal, it is an indirect free-kick.” And then there is the unlikely but not unforeseen situation in which a team physician comes on to the field during play. “If the doctor does it, it is a drop ball, which again is wrong for football. Their team benefits from breaking the law. So they will become direct free-kicks or penalty kicks.”Penalty shootoutsElleray: “If a player gets sent off during kicks from the penalty mark, the other team does not also go down to 10. So if it goes all the way through, the guilty team’s best player takes a second kick against the innocent team’s worst player.”In future both teams will be reduced to the same number of penalty-takers.Elleray: “We are trying to make sure the laws are fair and support the team that has been offended against and do not reward people for breaking the laws of the game.”Offside inconsistencyElleray: “Part of the law book says when players commit an offside offence you give a free-kick where the offence occurred. The other part of the law book says you give a free-kick where the player was when he was in the offside position. So a player can actually move 20 yards from being in an offside position … and it is only the moment he plays the ball that he is penalised. The law tells you to give the free-kick in two different places.“So, in future, the free-kick will always be given where he commits the offside offence, even if he is in his own half, because you cannot be in an offside position in your own half, but you can go back into your own half to commit an offside offence.”Logo loopholeClub logos will be allowed on corner flags. Elleray: “It happens in the Premier League but is actually against the laws of the game.”Common senseElleray: “We are encouraging referees to referee according to the spirit of the game and to use common sense. ... If you can play the game and there is a minor breach of the law, report it to the authorities and sort it out afterwards. Do not be too black and white in minor areas.”That means, for example, in the grass-roots game, not abandoning a match if one of the four corner flags is broken.

Sunderland’s England prospect Jordan Pickford in squad for Arsenal trip
~~AUTHOR~~
Louise Taylor
~CONTENTS~
Jordan Pickford is expected to make his debut for Sunderland in Saturday’s FA Cup tie at Arsenal, with Sam Allardyce hoping the goalkeeper will follow in the footsteps of Joe Hart and Jack Butland.Pickford, an England Under-21 international, is extremely highly rated and, after shining on loan at Preston, has been recalled early to the Stadium of Light. The fact that Allardyce is prepared to sell Vito Mannone or Costel Pantilimon – who have been competing to be first choice – this month indicates that Sunderland’s manager hopes Pickford will quickly establish himself as his No1.Sam Allardyce ready to rebuild Sunderland around Jermain Defoe Read more“I don’t want to put too much pressure on young Pickford but he’s had some rave reviews at Preston,” said Allardyce. “He’s a Sunderland boy and a Sunderland fan and he’s made such an outstanding impact at Preston it would have been wrong of me not to bring him back here. He will play in the first team at some stage. I hope he follows in the footsteps of Joe Hart and Jack Butland.”Goalkeeping experts are convinced the 21-year-old possesses the potential to win full England honours and Pickford’s return sends a clear message to Pantilimon and Mannone.“What does it say to Costel and Vito?” said Allardyce. “There’s more pressure, perform better. Somebody else is knocking on their door now. I don’t know what will happen, but I know Pickford won’t be going anywhere, that’s for sure. If there was to be an offer from somebody else for either Costel or Vito, I’d probably call them in and say: ‘What do you want to do? Does it suit you and does it suit us?’ If that happens, we’ll talk about it.”With Sunderland facing a relegation six-pointer at Swansea on Wednesday before next Saturday’s trip to Tottenham Hotspur, Allardyce – who remains furious that the Premier League agreed to Swansea’s request to put next week’s game back to Wednesday from its original Tuesday slot – will rotate his squad against the Cup holders at the Emirates.“Our position is that Premier League status is everything,” he said. “Our priority is to stay up at all costs. Everything else is secondary. That’s what the owner tells me.”As a result a couple of key individuals were left behind when the Sunderland squad flew to Luton on Friday night, with Tom Beadling, an untried 19-year-old centre-half, taking one of the spare seats on the plane south. “You could say we’re going to play one or two young players at Arsenal,” said Allardyce. “The rest have played Premier League football.“Young Tom Beadling will be in the squad but it won’t be youngsters across the board in the team – it’ll only be one or two, and the rest will be seasoned experienced professionals who have been here all season. There will be one or two players rested who won’t travel, who have been playing every single game over the Christmas period. There’ll be one or two who have niggles, without them really being that serious, and they’ll also be rested [on the bench] to get ready for Swansea and Tottenham. We’ll use our squad to its full potential.”

David Ospina can still be Arsenal’s No1 keeper, says Arsène Wenger
~~AUTHOR~~
James Riach
~CONTENTS~
Arsène Wenger believes David Ospina can still be Arsenal’s first-choice goalkeeper in the future, with the Colombian to return to the team as the FA Cup holders attempt to win the competition for a third year in a row.Ospina has not played since Arsenal’s 3-2 defeat by Olympiakos in September, when he dropped the ball into his own net from a corner, but is set for a run in the Cup if Wenger’s side advance past Sunderland in the third round on Saturday.Sam Allardyce is expected to rotate his selection at the Emirates, having criticised the scheduling next midweek of a round of Premier League matches. Arsenal, whose Cup success in 2014 ended a nine-year trophy drought, have Mikel Arteta available, although Wenger may rest Mesut Özil. Alexis Sánchez is not expected to return from a hamstring injury until after Wednesday’s game against Liverpool.FA Cup third round: 10 ties to look out for this weekend Read morePetr Cech’s arrival from Chelsea last summer has provided Arsenal with much-needed stability and quality in goal. Ospina has made only three appearances this season, in the Champions League and Capital One Cup, but has a bright future at the club, according to Wenger.“I believe that Ospina is not treated fairly,” said Arsenal’s manager. “If you look at the whole of 2015, everybody neglects he played six months. I personally think he is world class. I did not take Petr Cech based on the performances of Ospina. Petr Cech was just an exceptional opportunity where it was difficult to say no.“It was not because I was unhappy with Ospina. I was very happy with Ospina. Unfortunately, Ospina has been punished by that decision. I rate him highly. True, he had a bad season because he has that mistake [against Olympiakos] and when you do not have many opportunities and you have one bad catch, everyone is after you. If you look at his performances from January to the end of the season, he saved us in many games.“We are lucky because he has a top attitude, is very intelligent, very brave, very quick. The difference with Cech is he has less experience and his size. Cech is so tall that when he stretches he covers more surface. I think he [Ospina] can be the goalkeeper of the future here as well. With Petr Cech getting [older] year after year, he may get more games.”Wenger confirmed that the France full-back Mathieu Debuchy would be allowed to leave on loan this month, although denied that there had yet been a formal approach from Aston Villa. He also said Mohamed Elneny’s proposed transfer from Basel would be completed in two to three days.Arsenal go into Saturday’s match as Premier League leaders, with a Champions League last-16 tie to come against Barcelona. However, Wenger insists the FA Cup, which he has won six times, remains a priority and that his side’s 2014 trophy came at a crucial time for the club.“It was vital,” said Wenger of Arsenal’s 3-2 victory over Hull City at Wembley. “I never forget that we were two down after 20 minutes and could have been three. It was vital, because you had that pressure to win trophies. We were consistent in our presence in the Champions League but it was vital to win trophies. For me, it was an important step.“Three times would be great but one of the most difficult rounds is the third round. Once you are in the competition the players get slowly in it. But the first game is always a bit difficult to get in there. The FA Cup is something special. Everybody loves it. It’s a dream to win the Cup.”

Steve McClaren cagey over Newcastle team for Watford FA Cup tie
~~AUTHOR~~
Louise Taylor
~CONTENTS~
Steve McClaren could be forgiven for fearing he will be damned if he does and damned if he doesn’t at Watford on Saturday. Newcastle United’s manager knows his teamsheet at Vicarage Road will come under unusual scrutiny but the former England coach must balance an ambition to keep bold pre-season promises about trying to win the FA Cup against the imperative of avoiding relegation.In eight FA Cup campaigns since Mike Ashley assumed ownership of the club, Newcastle have not progressed beyond the fourth round and the St James’ Park hierarchy openly admit the competition was previously low priority. Although that stance has altered they have made it clear that another early exit at Watford would not affect their manager’s job security.Newcastle’s Steve McClaren: top-eight league target was too ambitious Read moreWhen, last summer, Ashley and McClaren pledged to start chasing trophies neither man bargained for the team sitting third bottom of the Premier League on third-round day before a Tuesday night league game at home to Manchester United. Four days later West Ham visit Tyneside and McClaren’s future may be back on the agenda.“We want to win and gain some momentum at Watford,” said McClaren who, in the wake of some decent performances but disappointing results, would welcome the morale boost provided by a victory. “But we have three games in a week and one or two players with niggles so we have to assess risks and decide whether to play them. We’ll put out the strongest team possible without taking risks.”He will omit Jack Colback to allow the midfielder to rest a tight hamstring and is expected to start Florian Thauvin and Siem de Jong – but gave little else away.A reminder that Fabricio Coloccini, his captain, has not started an FA Cup tie for four years prompted a broad smile. “He’s trained all week,” he said. “You’ll find out tomorrow.” So what about Moussa Sissoko and Gini Wijnaldum, two other mainstays? “We’ll see,” said McClaren, before suggesting fate has dealt him a tough hand. “Arguably this is one of the round’s toughest ties. Watford are very strong. We could play our strongest XI, still get beat and I’d still probably get accused of: ‘Why did he play that lot?’”

Louis van Gaal wonders if Manchester United dressing room is too friendly
~~AUTHOR~~
Jamie Jackson
~CONTENTS~
Louis van Gaal has stated the atmosphere between his Manchester United players is too cordial and suggested the squad would benefit from being more critical of one another and of themselves.His side welcome Sheffield United to Old Trafford on Saturday in the third round of the FA Cup and the Dutchman has eased the pressure on his position following a goalless draw with Chelsea and last Saturday’s 2-1 win over Swansea City, United’s first victory in nine matches.Asked if there had been a better mood at the club since the display against Chelsea, Van Gaal said: “I don’t think so. The atmosphere in our dressing room is very good. Maybe too good because they are always protecting the dressing room, their colleagues. That is very good until a certain height.”Louis van Gaal: no worry Pep Guardiola could replace me at Manchester United Read moreThe implication of this is that the changing room can be a cosy environment. This is in contrast to the claim made by Gary Neville about United under Sir Alex Ferguson. Following a David de Gea mistake that gifted Tottenham Hotspur a late equaliser at White Hart Lane, the former United captain said: “There is an incredible amount of accountability in that dressing room. It is not a place that is forgiving, it is not a place where you won’t get people who will confront each other when mistakes are made.”Van Gaal is clear how the lack of accountability in his team can be eradicated. “We have also changed our approach to the players to make it easier to take responsibility,” he said. “We are trying everything to come to a solution but at the end it always comes down to we are better than the opponents but we have to score goals.“I have stimulated them to think about football. The game is a brain sport and now you can let them think with you and therefore you can change your approach and so the players take the [responsibility], for example for the gameplan and other kinds of decisions and then the [responsibility] is higher and bigger.“But we have to see how it shall work.”This week the style played by Van Gaal was criticised by Herbert Hainer, the chief executive of Adidas. The company is paying United a record £750m over the next decade as the kit sponsor. Van Gaal attempted to shrug this off. “He is more interested in revenues and these were very good.”Adnan Januzaj is back at United after his season’s loan at Borussia Dortmund proved unsuccessful because of a lack of game time and he is unavailable to play in the tie due to lack of fitness. Van Gaal denied that it was make-or-break for the Belgian’s career at the club. “You cannot predict something just because of talent – you have to develop it,” he said. “We have to see that from him. That’s why we put him on loan, because I predicted, already then, that he shall not play too much.“I cannot predict now if he has changed or that he already has his development, because he didn’t play. I cannot do two things – be here and in Dortmund to watch him training.”Van Gaal refused to be drawn on whether Januzaj should have been good enough to have stayed at United and played in the first XI. “I cannot judge that, neither can you,” he said. “That you have to ask him, not to me. I have an interest in him, of course, otherwise I would not take him back. But I cannot judge, and you cannot judge me.”Phil Jones is unavailable for the visit of Sheffield United because of a foot problem but Jesse Lingard has recovered from his hamstring injury and Will Keane may feature after his return from a temporary spell at Preston.

Sheffield United’s Nigel Adkins: ‘It’s the Theatre of Dreams. Why can’t we dream?’
~~AUTHOR~~
Paul Wilson
~CONTENTS~
Only one manager outside Old Trafford habitually refers to Manchester United’s home as the Theatre of Dreams, and through the magic of the FA Cup Saturday evening will find him making a belated pitchside debut at the place.Sheffield United’s visit to the nation’s grandest club is not quite a dream come true for Nigel Adkins, more a case of one put on hold. When Southampton came into the Premier League under his guidance four years ago he was busy preparing for his first visit to Old Trafford when he was sacked in favour of Mauricio Pochettino. Adkins briefly kept his Premier League status alive with a switch to Reading but they were on their way out of the division and had already been to Manchester United.FA Cup third round: 10 ties to look out for this weekend Read moreSo for a manager who idolised Sir Alex Ferguson to the extent of obtaining his autograph when the pair were presented with awards at a Northern Football Writers’ dinner, one in charge of Manchester United, the other making a name for himself at Scunthorpe United, the chance to finally patrol the same technical area ranks high as a personal achievement. “It would have been better still with Sir Alex in the other dugout but I’m not complaining,” Adkins says. “It will be a privilege to meet a coach as successful as Louis van Gaal and when I look out I’ll see Sir Alex’s name on the opposite stand. That’s good enough for me. I’ll know I have arrived then.”Adkins did encounter Ferguson in games at St Mary’s while at Southampton, though the extent to which he was looking forward to taking him on at Old Trafford can be gauged from the meticulousness of his preparations for the visit he was anticipating in 2013.“I took my wife to see a game there that year because I was interested to see what the dugout was like,” Adkins recalls. “We had just played at Everton and I found it very hard to get messages through to the players from the dugout there. On television Manchester United looked as if it might also be difficult so I thought I’d do a bit of a recce. Having seen it I think it probably will be difficult. I don’t know how Sir Alex did it for so long. It’s such a big pitch to shout across too. It might be time for the old non-verbal communication system to come into play. If you see me standing with my arms behind my back, everything will be going OK. If my arms are crossed I’m a little worried. Down on one knee I’m perplexed, and if I am waving my arms and kicking water bottles you can take it that I’m not happy.”It seems almost pointless to ask whether Adkins intends to take the Cup tie seriously. Some managers with a league game on Tuesday and a play-off position to be secured might prefer not to be distracted from the league, but this is emphatically not one of them. “We are going to the Theatre of Dreams,” Adkins says. “So why can’t we dream? If you can’t enjoy a challenge like Manchester United what can you look forward to? I must admit I gulped at first when the draw was made, but then I thought no, it’s a great draw. The players will enjoy it, the supporters deserve it, the club will benefit financially. I wouldn’t dare make changes. All the players want to play for a start, and I wouldn’t like to short-change the fans because Old Trafford tickets aren’t cheap. We are taking around 8,500 and we are all going to enjoy it because there’s no pressure for a change.“In our division we are the scalp, the big club everyone raises their game against. This is fifth in the Premier League versus eighth in League One. A massive gulf. On paper we have no chance but we all know the FA Cup does not always work like that.”One pleasing aspect of the tie from Adkins’ point of view is the chance to renew acquaintance with Morgan Schneiderlin, a player he helped bring through the ranks at Southampton. He is not at all surprised to see him thriving at the top level. “We knew straight away what a gifted player he was,” he recalls. “His ability was obvious but at first we questioned his work rate and strength. When Morgan first arrived he was just a petulant young kid, forever throwing his arms in the air in training, wanting a free-kick every time he felt the slightest nudge. If someone went in hard on him he would stop playing for the next five minutes. We would all be shouting at him to get on with the game. Eventually he knuckled down, to be fair, and now he’s a French international playing for Manchester United. You feel proud as Punch that you might have had some small part to play in the lad’s development but we had a good set-up at Southampton. We had some really good pros to show him how to conduct himself. Dean Hammond was the captain and he’s with us now, so if Morgan plays he will meet up with him again.”Schneiderlin has just returned the compliment. “He was a joy to work with, a manager who didn’t get enough time in the Premier League,” the midfielder said, before accurately pinning down his former boss as always optimistic and always wearing a smile. “Morgan grew up in the Championship, especially the season we came up,” Adkins says. “In the Premier League all the stats indicated that he was our strongest, fittest player, the one who ran more than anyone else. But the stats for Southampton as a team were also pretty good. Even Mauricio Pochettino acknowledged that he took over a very fit side.” When I look out I’ll see Sir Alex’s name on the opposite stand. That’s good enough for me Adkins, 50, does not try to pretend that being sacked did not hurt – “I lost my job and I didn’t want to lose my job, I took myself away for a week” – but found offers came his way sooner than expected. “I spent a week studying Hamburg with access all areas, then Reading phoned me up and all of a sudden I was back in work,” he says. “First game up was Southampton, but I wanted to be involved again, I couldn’t say no.”It was the same when Sheffield United made contact last year, after Adkins had spent his post-Reading interim studying basketball in the US, being shown around the New England scene by Paul Mariner, then getting so close to the England rugby set-up he was actually in the dressing room – “I was thinking I shouldn’t be there really” – during a Six Nations game against France.“Once I had established that the Sheffield call wasn’t a wind-up I had to think about whether I should go down to League One or wait for a bigger club to come along,” Adkins says. “That didn’t take long. This is a big club. I was out of work. What would have been the point of waiting? Football is a competitive industry, you have to strive to prove yourself all the time. That’s the reality, you can’t whinge about it. Fortunately I love working in football, even when it is Manchester United away.”In the case of one of the last romantics, perhaps especially when it is Manchester United away.

Liverpool’s Brad Smith strikes to deny Exeter a memorable FA Cup scalp
~~AUTHOR~~
Stuart James
~CONTENTS~
In the end everything turned out rather well for Exeter City, even if this will be remembered as a night when a golden opportunity to eliminate Liverpool from the FA Cup and register one of the most famous victories in the League Two club’s history slipped through their fingers.Brad Smith, a 21-year-old Australian who was making only his fifth appearance for Liverpool, equalised 17 minutes from time to spare Jürgen Klopp the embarrassment of an upset that looked on the cards from the moment the teams were announced. The bad news for Liverpool’s manager is that another fixture has to be crowbarred into an already congested schedule and, with that in mind, it was tempting to wonder whether a draw was the worst possible scenario for Klopp.Jürgen Klopp to pick callow Liverpool side again for Exeter Cup replay Read moreWith 12 Liverpool players missing through injury, the tie being played on a pudding of a pitch, live television cameras in town and Exeter right up for the occasion, all the ingredients were there for a famous upset and for a long period it looked as though Paul Tisdale’s side would deliver one of those famous FA Cup stories.Smith, however, had not read the script and his close-range left-footed shot, after Jordan Moore-Taylor cleared off the line, means Exeter will travel to Anfield on Wednesday week for a replay and quite a payday. Early estimations are that a share of the gate receipts at Liverpool could be worth as much as £500,000 to Exeter.That should soften the blow for Tisdale, whose disappointment afterwards reflected how close his impressive side had come to giving Klopp an unwelcome first taste of what the FA Cup is all about. Exeter’s manager had every right to feel proud of his players, who performed with courage and belief.The home team sensed blood from the outset, took the lead through Tom Nichols’ 10th goal of the season and, when Lee Holmes scored direct from a corner kick on the stroke of half-time, to restore their advantage after Jerome Sinclair had equalised in the 12th minute, Klopp’s face was a picture.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Tom Nichols slides the ball past Adam Bogdan to score Exeter’s first goal. Photograph: Andrew Powell/Liverpool FC via Getty ImagesIt was not a moment that Adam Bogan, the Liverpool goalkeeper, will want to view again and added to the growing impression that this was going to be Exeter’s night. Bogdan was one of the few recognisable names in the Liverpool side, along with José Enrique, who was making his first appearance for the club in the best part of 12 months, and Christian Benteke.Liverpool’s £32.5m signing played the full 90 minutes and it must have been a chastening experience for the Belgium international. He was unlucky to see his powerful header tipped over the bar by Bobby Olejnik early in the second half but he was a peripheral figure for much of the evening and could have been forgiven for wondering how his Liverpool career has got to the point where he has ended up playing in a team of virtual unknowns.Klopp’s starting lineup showed 11 changes from the team that started against Stoke City in the Capital One Cup semi-final first leg on Tuesday night. In fact, take Benteke and Enrique out of that XI and the other nine players had only 18 Liverpool appearances between them.In that context Klopp could have been forgiven for fearing the worst when Exeter took the lead after nine minutes following a raid down Liverpool’s left flank. Jamie Reid was the creator, the forward showing a mixture of pace and strength to get away from Enrique before delivering a low inch-perfect cross that was expertly steered in by Nichols.Liverpool, to their credit, quickly responded, albeit after some calamitous Exeter defending. Ryan Kent, who started brightly, looked to pass into the feet of Benteke in the area and, as the ball broke loose, two Exeter players seemed to get in one another’s way. Jordan Tillson ended up swinging a wild left boot at the ball and it fell kindly for Sinclair, who finished clinically from about 10 yards on his first start for the club.Liverpool struggle to find right wavelength after warm Exeter reception Read moreExeter, however, looked the more dangerous of the two teams. David Noble might have done better when he lifted a shot over the bar and Christian Ribeiro, who was keen to get forward on the right at every opportunity, narrowly headed wide of the far upright with Bogdan beaten.The Liverpool goalkeeper was not so fortunate four minutes later. Holmes stuck his left-footed corner kick with pace and precision, the ball arrowing over the head of Bogan, who ended up hanging on to the crossbar, and into the far corner of the net to put Exeter back in front.Although Benteke saw his header saved, Exeter were growing in confidence in the second half and it was difficult to see where the Liverpool equaliser was going to come from. Yet Sheyi Ojo, who was one of five Liverpool debutants, made an instant impact when his break down the left, only two minutes after coming off the bench, led to Smith drilling home.While “a tad disappointed” with the result, Tisdale could also see the silver lining. “A windfall like this is the sort of cash injection we don’t get,” he said. “We’re going to get a payday and it’s about keeping going what we have, not just signing new players but re-employing players, so it’s a big achievement for us tonight. We’re very frugal, careful with every penny, so I just can’t over-emphasise how important this will be for a club like Exeter.”

Bournemouth in talks with Wolves striker Benik Afobe over transfer
~CONTENTS~
Bournemouth are in talks with the Wolves striker Benik Afobe. It is understood the 22-year-old could seal a move to the Cherries over the weekend, with the south coast side aiming to bolster their forward line.Norwich hold a long-term interest in Afobe and had several bids rejected in the summer but Bournemouth now appear the frontrunners for his signature, although a fee is yet to be confirmed.Yaya Touré: awarding African player of year to Aubameyang is pathetic Read moreBournemouth’s manager, Eddie Howe, lost Callum Wilson for the season to a serious knee injury in September and has already signed Roma’s Juan Iturbe on loan until May.Bournemouth are 16th in the table, four points above the Barclays Premier League relegation zone, and go to Birmingham in the FA Cup third round on Saturday.Afobe joined Wolves for £2m from Arsenal only last January and has scored 23 goals in 48 games for the club. He has 10 in 27 outings this season for the Sky Bet Championship side.On Thursday the Wolves manager, Kenny Jackett, denied they had received any bids for the forward but the club have hinted they could sell this month.Last month the chief executive, Jez Moxey, refused to rule out a sale, despite the club issuing a statement in the summer insisting Afobe would not be sold this season.The club’s owner, Steve Morgan, put the club up for sale in September and is looking for close to £40m and Jackett admitted that has had an impact on the club.He said: “Rather than just this window it has had an effect on the whole club; there is no doubt about it. It is Steve’s decision how much money he puts in. When does he sell to who? What are the circumstances? There is only really him that can answer that.”

All hail the concrete Catalonia! South London’s golden square of talent
~~AUTHOR~~
Barney Ronay
~CONTENTS~
There was much snarky amusement a few years back when plans were unveiled to transform Croydon, south London’s grey, unloved sub-suburban satellite town, into “the new Barcelona”. Under a new municipal scheme a region described by David Bowie as “everything I didn’t want in my life, everything I wanted to get away from” would be transported from a deep-concrete nightmare of tower blocks and strangulating traffic into an uplifting place crammed with boulevards, glass towers, “sky gardens” and actual nice bits.In fairness Barcelona is still probably just about shading it for now. But something is happening in Croydon. For a start it’s producing professional footballers, and lots of them. Twenty years ago Harry Pearson wrote a brilliant book called The Far Corner, a love letter to football in the north-east, which was still very much the “hot-bed” of the domestic game. England had just reached the World Cup semi-finals with four north-east players in the team. Bob Paisley and Brian Clough had won more European Cups than Germany. The idea of a frothingly ambitious manager willingly moving from Newcastle to Crystal Palace really wouldn’t have made much sense at all.How times change. Anyone attempting a similar anatomy of English football’s most productive centre a few years from now may find themselves looking south. In fact it might be worth starting with a 10 mile square of suburban south-east London bordered by the Barcelona of the A23 at its south-western edge, with Orpington, Woolwich and Lambeth the other three corners. Because right now this seems to be where it’s at.How Crystal Palace became one of the Premier League's unlikely success stories Read moreOn Saturday Crystal Palace, a club at the estuary between the rich waters of Croydon and south-east London, will play Southampton in the FA Cup. It is a meeting of arguably the two most locally centred squads in the Premier League, a fixture that could see as many as four players on each team either born, raised or schooled within a few miles of their current club.If the success of Southampton’s academy has been well rehearsed the emergence of south London as the breadbasket of the Premier League is less celebrated. This is hardly one of the traditional football heartlands. In the past century south of the Thames has burped up the odd England player of note, from Vivian Woodward of Kennington to Rio Ferdinand of Peckham. But the industrial north, Merseyside, Essex and the East End have been the real production powerhouses. Until now. Currently 14% of English footballers in the Premier League are from that 10 mile golden square of south London. The borough of Croydon alone – home to 0.6% of the population – has produced 5% of all active English Premier League players, among them Wilfried Zaha, Victor Moses and Lewis Grabban from Palace and more disparately Jamal Blackman of Chelsea and Jason Puncheon and Kieran Gibbs via the original Wimbledon.It is a rich seam that stretches up from the West Croydon basin, through the Surrey canal to the docks at Rotherhithe and then east along the river. With benefits for all too. Liverpool’s transfer committee may have been a clearing house for the lost and confused in recent years. But in Nathaniel Clyne, Joe Gomez and Jordon Ibe (Brixton, Greenwich, Bermondsey) they have hauled in probably the best of young London.With more to come too. Even now should the London-Croydon nexus declare national independence a current XI of Blackman, Clyne, Gomez, Chris Smalling, Ryan Bertrand, Puncheon, Ruben Loftus-Cheek, Ben Watson, Ibe, Moses and Zaha could probably make it to the next Euros. All hail the concrete Catalonia!      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   The Liverpool duo Jordon Ibe and Nathaniel Clyne are among a host of young English players to come out of south London. Photograph: Carl Recine/ReutersThere are some simple explanations for this. Suburban south London is a large, prosperous catchment area these days. A school with a little sport left in it, a supportive parent with a car and money for subs: this is the most common route now into an academy-led system that increasingly throws up players from distant suburban areas.Plus, when it comes to south-east London it is inevitable that race will come in too, if only because pretty much every one of the golden square’s young Premier League players is black or mixed race, part of London’s familiar story of immigrants, children of immigrants, children of children of immigrants. Whether you celebrate the idea of a cultural melting pot or choose to live in an imaginary 1920s of your own devising, this is surely a sign of something going right somewhere.I played as a kid in the south London leagues and it must be said it was a pretty racist and disorderly place at times. Read Ian Wright’s first autobiography and there are enough incidental details about how hard it was getting on back then in south London, how brutal football’s environment could be. Things have changed. Football may have its problems, but it does have more progressive, inclusive, productive structures. Just look at some of the kids it’s churning out now. Ibe, Gomez and Clyne: these are some pretty mature, admirable, well-formed young men. Treat them right and Liverpool have a sound south London core there for the next decade or so. You’re welcome!Plus of course power and wealth in English football is increasingly clustered in the south. London’s riches and huge population, the clumping together in one short urban radius of talent, scouts, travel links, overseas investors, hope, opportunity: this all feeds and nourishes itself. Manchester and Liverpool have prospered for the same reasons as London: overseas money and a resonant name. But the great, clanking corrugated theatres of English football over the last century – Elland Road, Hillsborough, the City Ground – are now strictly localised points of interest.Meanwhile London continues to whirl and churn, a great chomping set of jaws flecking everybody around it with a rich spittle of crumbs and leftovers. West Ham are currently freewheeling into a brand new stadium built with £600m of public money. Tottenham, like Arsenal, can borrow and build, in part because London will always provide. QPR, Charlton and Fulham seem to have found the wrong kind of egotistical billionaire but never mind. When you’re a Londoner salvation is only ever an ambitious sovereign wealth fund away. For Palace, burning through the current TV money but more or less assured of a more profitable future, an imminent US-led redevelopment may bring something else, perhaps a more remote, more corporate club. But not before south London’s golden square, the Barcelona of the Brighton Road, has had its day.

Barcelona’s Dani Alves slams ‘garbage’ press on social media
~CONTENTS~
The Barcelona defender Dani Alves launched a foul-mouthed tirade on social media on Friday over football coverage by the Spanish press.The outspoken full-back hit out at what he described as sensationalism by the media in a message on Instagram.Spanish prosecutors want Neymar to be charged with fraud and corruption Read moreHe did not refer to any specific incident, although he also posted a photograph from Barça’s fiery derby against Espanyol on Wednesday.“Truly each day I feel more embarrassed to be a part of this sport, the way we are used and the way they play with us,” Alves wrote. “We are objects used by the press for their benefit, so they sell newspapers. Less and less they talk about football, strategy, play, the runs to score goals, the saves and the spectacle,” he added before using an expletive to condemn the media in general.Barça quickly distanced themselves from the comments.“Dani Alves published on Instagram a very critical message where he used offensive language,” the club said in a statement. “While these are the views of the player, which they are free to express, Barcelona feels it necessary to clarify that it does not share these offensive expressions that have been published.”Barça have played Espanyol twice in the last week and tension has been rising since the La Liga clash that ended 0-0 on Saturday when there were complaints from Barça players over their opponents’ physical play.Barça won the first leg of the Copa del Rey last-16 clash on Wednesday 4-1 and Espanyol had two players sent off.There was a confrontation in the tunnel after the game which led to Barcelona striker Luis Suárez receiving a two-match ban for using provocative language.It is not the first time Alves has criticised the media. During a news conference last May he refused to listen to a question from Radio Marca which he said was biased towards Madrid clubs.

Swansea City’s Alan Curtis: I’ve never really seen myself as a manager
~CONTENTS~
Alan Curtis has said he has settled into the role of manager after being tasked with securing Swansea City’s Premier League status.On Thursday, Curtis was promoted from the caretaker position he has held since Garry Monk’s departure on 9 December to a full-time role until the end of the season. It is a huge responsibility for the 61-year-old who has spent four decades at Swansea as player and coach, with the club only two points above the relegation places.Swansea take a breather from the league with an FA Cup trip to Oxford United on Sunday, and Curtis accepts that he has had to get used to the sharp end of management.Napoli reject £14.1m Swansea bid for Italy forward Manolo Gabbiadini Read more“I’ve never really seen myself as a manager but you can quickly change that mindset,” Curtis said before the third-round tie at the Kassam Stadium. “When you get given an opportunity to make sure the club stays in the Premier League you quite quickly switch into manager mode.“I’ve never really aspired to be a manager, especially in the Premier League, but we’ll see how this period goes. The most important thing is that we retain our Premier League status. That’s all my concentration is on at the moment, these last 18 games.”Curtis has overseen an improvement in performances in his five games in charge and landed the job for the rest of the season after Brendan Rodgers, the former Swansea manager, chose to continue his break from football following his October exit from Liverpool.Swansea’s chairman Huw Jenkins’ trip to South America to speak to the former Argentina and Chile coach Marcelo Bielsa also came to nothing, as did overtures to the likes of Gus Poyet, Dennis Bergkamp, Roberto Di Matteo and José Mourinho’s former Chelsea assistant José Morais.Jenkins revealed in a statement on Thursday evening “a lot of potential managers” did not want the job now for one reason or another, prompting the Swansea board to hand Curtis the task of keeping the club in the Premier League for a sixth successive season.“It’s a huge responsibility, but I could never have turned it down,” Curtis said. “With the quality we’ve got, I’m really confident we’ll be OK. There’ll be a fine if they call me boss! It’s banned from the training ground.“I’m determined not to change my nature, and I will do it as I see fit. A lot of it is just finding your feet and just running with it. It’s a new experience for me and for the players to have me as their manager but there’s certainly been a great response in training as well as in games.”After the Oxford tie, in which Curtis is expected to rest several first-team players, fellow strugglers Sunderland and Watford visit the Liberty Stadium in the space of five days. Those two games may go a long way to determining how Swansea will fare in the next few months, but Curtis remains in a positive frame of mind.“We’ve got good players, I think we’re capable and we’ve shown our capabilities in the last few games,” Curtis said. “The two defeats have been to teams [Manchester City and Manchester United] chasing Champions League football. We know what we have to do, it’s going to be a slog from now till the end of the season.”

Leicester’s Jamie Vardy may miss both Tottenham games after groin operation
~CONTENTS~
Jamie Vardy will not be rushed back by Leicester City after undergoing a minor groin operation. The joint-leading scorer in the Premier League required surgery to repair a longstanding problem and had the operation this week.FA Cup third round: 10 ties to look out for this weekend Read moreThe procedure was a success and the 28-year-old is expected to need around 10 days to recover, meaning he could be back in contention for the league game against Tottenham next Wednesday.However, Claudio Ranieri may not risk him at White Hart Lane next week in a fixture that comes three days after the two sides meet at the same venue in the FA Cup third round.“He’s OK,” the manager said. “Today [Thursday] Jamie is working with the physio and he should be OK for the league game. I say to my physio I do not want to lose him for a long time. If he is ready for the second Tottenham game, it’s OK. If not – Aston Villa.”Leicester have been this season’s surprise package in the Premier League but Tottenham, their FA Cup opponents on Sunday, have impressed Ranieri, who used the north London club as an example of how he wants the Foxes to progress.“They have a lot of young players. Why? Because they started earlier than us,” said the Italian, who could hand a debut to the 19-year-old winger Demarai Gray following his arrival from Birmingham this week. “Pochettino is doing a good job. Their squad is fantastic. When we drew with Tottenham at home earlier [this season] I felt they were something special.“It is difficult to play Tottenham because they have fantastic players. They have a first team and second team the same. They have a good mix of young and old. We want to follow their example.“When I signed, [club owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha] told me he wants to build good, young players and a team that can compete with the big teams, to get into Europe in two or three years, after that the Champions League. I said we’ll work hard to achieve it. We want to improve. It is my first six months that I am working with these players. We have to improve a lot. We already improve, but we need more, I believe.”As he did in the League Cup this season, Ranieri will also make wholesale changes to his team in the FA Cup. He said: “We will change a lot, because these players deserve a chance to play. It will be a blend of players. Our mentality won’t change. We go to win. If Tottenham are better, well done to them.”

Anthony Stokes to go out on loan from Celtic says assistant John Collins
~CONTENTS~
The Celtic assistant manager, John Collins, has revealed Anthony Stokes will go out on loan but insists his career at the club is not necessarily over.The Republic of Ireland forward has been frozen out of Ronny Deila’s plans this season, playing just twice, and was recently suspended for two weeks for tweeting his dissatisfaction at being left out of the squad after travelling to Inverness.The Caley Thistle manager, John Hughes, who was in charge of the 27-year-old at Falkirk and Hibernian, has inquired about the possibility of teaming up with the player again.Asked if allowing Stokes to leave on loan signalled the end of his career at Parkhead, Collins said: “It signals it for the rest of this season if he goes on loan.“But you never know in football. The door is always open. The manager and Anthony have decided it would be good for him to get some game time.“There has been a relationship with those two [Hughes and Stokes] before, they have worked well with each other in the past so it might be a good place for Anthony to go.“There are other teams interested as well but we won’t force him to go where he doesn’t want to go, it will be his choice. He has to go away, score goals and play well, that is what football is all about.“His attitude lately in training has been very good so hopefully he has turned the corner. But he needs games.”On speculation that Aiden McGeady could return from Everton, Collins, speaking ahead of the Scottish Cup fourth-round tie against Stranraer at Stair Park on Sunday, said: “I don’t think it was realistic. He is a Premier League player on Premier League wages.“We have always got to be realistic. We have budgets and there is a big gap between the Premier League and the Championship and our league. I would rule that out, yes.”

Spanish prosecutors want Neymar to be charged with fraud and corruption
~~AUTHOR~~
Guardian sport
~CONTENTS~
Spanish prosecutors have reportedly requested that Neymar be charged on two counts of fraud and corruption relating to his move to Barcelona during the summer of 2013.Quoting the radio station Cadena Ser, Marca reported that prosecutors have also asked for charges to be brought against the Barça president, Josep Maria Bartomeu; former president, Sandro Rosell; Neymar’s father, who is also his son’s agent; two directors of the Brazilian striker’s former club Santos; and the two football clubs themselves.The prosecutors acted on legal proceedings brought by the Brazilian investment fund DIS, which has accused the defendants of fraud, claiming it should have received 40% of the payment that Barcelona paid Santos for the player.DIS, which held 40% of Neymar’s sports rights when he was in Brazil, claims it only received that percentage for €17.1m that Santos was allegedly paid for the Brazilian when, according to high court investigations, the deal cost €83.3m (£62m).The defendants also stand accused of corruption over allegations that Neymar, despite being under contract at DIS – and without informing the fund - signed a deal with Barcelona worth €40m to join the team as soon as he was a free agent.At the same time, Neymar is at the centre of an investigation into alleged tax fraud over the move in which Barcelona have previously made a supplementary payment of almost €13m to the Spanish authorities in order to cover what they described as a difference in “interpretation”.The case is based on the investigating judge’s allegation that Barcelona’s claim to have paid Santos €17.1 and €40m to the company run by Neymar’s father was false. Instead, Barcelona were accused of having paid over €80m for the Brazil striker and making a series of different payments that the investigator considered to actually be part of the player’s salary. Prosecutors alleged that the Spanish exchequer had been defrauded of €12.7m in taxes.Neymar has previously declared himself “sick and tired” of accusations his family improperly profited from his transfer and said there was “nothing illegal” in his contract with Barcelona.Bartomeu and Rosell could face prison sentences of two years and three months over the tax case, and seven years respectively, while prosecutors also want the club to face a fine of €22.2m.Barcelona have not yet offered any public statement but have repeatedly declared their innocence as has Bartomeu. Rosell resigned as president in January 2014, citing an “unfair and reckless accusation of misappropriation” in regards to the case.In another action, a Brazilian court has frozen €42m in assets belonging to Neymar over tax evasion allegations.

TV illusionists pretending this stage of the FA Cup is still as special as ever

~CONTENTS~
A KIND OF MAGICWith the third round upon us, The Fiver is as overcome as everyone else with the magic of the FA Cup. Well, it’s a kind of magic. Hey presto! Watch in astonishment as the British Broadcasting Corporation make any chance travelling Liverpool supporters have of getting a train home on the same day as their team’s match against Exeter City vanish into thin air! Ala-kazam! Stare in awe as various Premier League managers saw their fans’ FA Cup interest in half by keeping one eye on the midweek fixtures by fielding second-string line-ups in this once great competition! Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo! Tune in with interest to see various TV illusionists pretend this stage in the competition is still as special as ever by dusting off footage of a 44-year-old goal scored by a team that no longer exists and sticking it on a mesmerising loop.The third round fun kicks off on Friday evening, when League Two side Exeter City entertain Premier League side Liverpool in a match that looks ripe for an upset massive enough to rival that experienced by the 1,347 travelling fans upon realising that, thanks to the whim of some pointy-head at the BBC, they’d have to take the day off work to attend a match that kicks off 90 minutes after the last train back to Liverpool leaves Exeter St Davids Station.“The trip for Liverpool fans to Exeter is no different to their visits to Swansea on a Monday night in the Premier League and a Wednesday trip to Southampton in the League Cup, both of which they have done in the last 12 months,” argued one unnamed and unsympathetic BBC spokesman in response to protestations from supporters, either not getting the point or totally getting it but not giving a flying one about them anyway. One suspects Equity might have something to say if the extras and walk-ons required for other BBC productions were dismissed so sniffily. As far as the game itself is concerned, expect famously dapper Exeter City manager Paul Tisdale to wear a porkpie hat, a silk cravat and perhaps a herringbone jacket as he attempts to spur his team on to victory. By contrast in the Liverpool ranks, most of their first team will be sporting bandages and ice-packs as they tune in to the coverage so considerately provided by the BBC. With 13 players sidelined through knack and Jürgen Klopp unwilling to risk those involved in four games in 11 days over the festive period, the German may be forced to further inconvenience the travelling 1,347 by calling on 11 of them to make up his team.LIVE ON BIG WEBSITEJoin Barry Glendenning from 7.55pm GMT for hot MBM coverage of Exeter City 0-2 Liverpool Reservesl.QUOTE OF THE DAY“I’m very, very disappointed.

Chelsea overtake Manchester clubs as wage bill for last season rises to £215.6m
~CONTENTS~
Chelsea have returned to the top of at least one Premier League table after annual figures revealed they have overtaken both Manchester clubs in terms of salaries paid to players.The 2014-15 figures, which have been made available on Companies House, show that Chelsea are the biggest payers in the top flight once more after losing that position to Manchester City in the 2011-12 season.The club, owned by the Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich, reported a total wage bill for last season that rose to £215.6m, up £25m.The salary bill for their leading rivals last season saw Manchester United’s at £203m, Manchester City’s at £193.5m and Arsenal paying out £192.2m on wages. Both Manchester clubs reported a drop in overall wages last season.Chelsea announced in November the club had made a net loss of £23.1m on turnover of £314.3m – down £5.1m – but said they were well within the boundaries for complying with Uefa’s financial fair play regulations.The full annual figures reveal, however, that the club made a £42m profit on player trading, through selling Romelu Lukaku, André Schürrle and Ryan Bertrand and despite bringing in Cesc Fàbregas and Diego Costa. In the 2013-14 season Chelsea made a £65m profit in player trading.The accounts also show that Abramovich injected funding to Chelsea via the club’s parent company to the tune of £46.7m last season, and £57.1m the previous year. The accounts state: “However … part of the debt has been converted into equity during the year via the allotment of ordinary shares.”

Louis van Gaal: no worry Pep Guardiola could replace me at Manchester United
~~AUTHOR~~
Jamie Jackson
~CONTENTS~
Louis van Gaal has claimed Pep Guardiola’s ambition to work in the Premier League next will have no impact on his position as Manchester United manager.FA Cup third round: 10 ties to look out for this weekend Read moreThis week the Spaniard confirmed he will leave Bayern Munch in the close season to manage in England. Guardiola is viewed as one of the world’s finest coaches. United, Manchester City, and Chelsea would all consider him as a potential manager at some juncture.Van Gaal has eased scrutiny on his job after the goalless draw with Chelsea and Saturday’s 2-1 victory over Swansea City, a first win in nine games. The Dutchman shrugged off the idea that Guardiola’s availability might affect him in the future.“I’m at the end of my career, so for me it’s not so interesting. For me it’s interesting how I take care of Manchester United and after this season I still have one year to go,” Van Gaal said of his three-year contract.“He [Guardiola] wants to sniff the culture of England and I wanted that also. I think that it is very good he wants to do that and I didn’t think it will have an impact on his club. Every manager has that right to announce that. It’s not for sure he will be the manager of a Premier League club next season.”Adnan Januzaj has rejoined Van Gaal’s squad after cutting short a season-long loan at Borussia Dortmund that proved unsuccessful because of a lack of appearances.“It’s more or less the same thing we have done with Will Keane,” the manager said of a striker who returned from Preston at the end of last month following a temporary spell at the Lancashire club. “They are coming to us to ask for a second chance and Manchester United is a club that takes care of all our players and I think it’s a very good habit to have that.“I believe in the talent of Adnan Januzaj. I said it would be very difficult to play matches in Dortmund and unfortunately I was right. But he could train here and maybe show talent in the first team. He has been tested already this morning, didn’t play so many 90-minute matches and has to show his fitness in the second team.”Januzaj may feature in Monday’s trip to Reading for the under-21s. “We have to wait and see if the papers are right. If he can play Monday in the second team he shall play in second team. He can show his quality.”Van Gaal denied that United’s displays against Chelsea and Swansea were more attacking. “I’m not agreeing with your analysis – we are playing always attacking football, only we have scored, that’s the big difference. That it shall give me confidence we have still to see that because one swallow doesn’t make a summer. I hope so.“I see that also in the training sessions but you have to show it also at a certain time for 90 minutes and that’s why football is so amazing because you never know.”

Yaya Touré: awarding African Player of Year to Aubameyang is pathetic
~~AUTHOR~~
Ed Aarons
~CONTENTS~
Yaya Touré has described the decision not to award him Africa’s Player of the Year for the fifth successive year as “pathetic” and “indecent” after the Manchester City and Ivory Coast midfielder finished as runner-up behind the Borussia Dortmund striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang.Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang pips Yaya Touré to African player of the year award Read moreThe Gabon international, who has scored 18 goals in 17 Bundesliga matches for Dortmund this season, was presented with the award in the Nigerian capital of Abuja on Thursday night after a vote of coaches and technical directors from Confederation of African Football nations placed him ahead of Touré. The 26-year-old amassed 143 points, with Touré – who last January led Ivory Coast to their first Cup of Nations triumph since 1992 – coming second with 136 points and Swansea’s André Ayew third with 112 points.On stage at the ceremony the City midfielder admitted he was “disappointed” but appeared magnanimous towards Aubameyang and told his rival he had “been doing brilliantly well this year”. However, Touré later revealed the depth of his frustration and appeared to suggest that the voting had been unfair given his country’s success at the Nations Cup.“I’m very, very disappointed. It’s sad to see Africa react this way, that they don’t think African achievements are important,” he said to the French radio station RFI.“I think this is what brings shame to Africa, because to act in that way is indecent. But what can we do about it? Us Africans, we don’t show that Africa is important in our eyes. We favour more what’s abroad than our own continent. That is pathetic.”Touré, who won the award in 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014, then added: “I’ll give an example. Messi won all the trophies but it’s Cristiano Ronaldo who won the award [Ballon d’Or 2014]. What would you say? It’s unfair.“But even Fifa, with all its history of corruption, wouldn’t do [what CAF judges did]. Yaya will take care of Yaya and let Africa take care of itself. As I’ve been told many times, you can’t take care of Africa too much because Africa will be the first to let you down.“When I return to Europe, a lot of questions will be asked. I think I’m going to have to answer them. As I’m someone who’s honest, I will always tell the truth.”   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest  Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang wins African Player of the Year.Ayew, who joined Swansea in the summer from Marseille, also seemed unhappy about finishing behind Aubameyang. In an interview with the French newspaper L’Equipe with the headline “Je m’interroge” (I’m wondering), the Ghana forward openly questioned the decision.He said: “I wonder can someone explain what is the criteria in a Cup of Nations year. It seems logical to me that the major competition of the continent is considered in the verdict. The Euro would count for Europeans but the Cup of Nations would not count for Africans?“Yaya and I were finalists at the Cup of Nations; he won, I finished top scorer. Then for our clubs, it was great as well – when I returned to Marseille (to finish the season) and I was also voted player of the month for August in England with Swansea. And Yaya, captain of the Elephants, had a good year too. So I thought it would be one of us...”Ayew then attempted to qualify his comments: “Wait, Aubameyang is a friend and he had a great year. And he is a great guy. He scored a lot of goals but Yaya and I are not in the same position, although that did not prevent us from being as decisive. We must focus our competitions. We must respect them. If we Africans, we do not, then who will? Frankly, it was Yaya or me this year.”The decision was also not very well received in Ghana or Ivory Coast, with some journalists suggesting that the poll had been manipulated to ensure Aubameyang came out on top. In particular Cameroon’s decision not to place Touré in the top five has been criticised, although the presence of his Ivory Coast team-mate Serge Aurier as coach Alexandre Belinga’s first choice makes it difficult to stand up that theory.Aubameyang has yet to respond directly to Touré’s and Ayew’s comments but did send a message to Cameroon’s Samuel Eto’o on Twitter on Friday evening thanking him for his support.Aubameyang P-E (@Aubameyang7)une pensée particulière pour @setoo9 quadruple ballon d'or pétrie de classe qui ma inspiré et encouragé dans ma carrière.Merci #grandfrereJanuary 8, 2016“A special thought for @setoo9 quadruple Golden Ball who has inspired and encouraged me in my career.

For Sam Allardyce a massive fixture headache is at hand: the start of three away trips in seven days means players will be rested. Mikel Arteta, Jeff Reine-Adelaide and Alex Iwobi are all in line to feature for Arsène Wenger.Match pointer Arsenal have not been knocked out at this stage since losing a replay to Sheffield United in 1996Birmingham City v BournemouthVenue St Andrew’s, Saturday 3pmRef Michael JonesOdds Birmingham City 3-1 Bournemouth 10-11 Draw 5-2New signing Juan Iturbe will not be able to make his debut for Bournemouth as he is still awaiting a work permit and Eddie Howe will also be without the suspended Simon Francis.

But the Walsall manager has admitted he is already thinking about Tuesday’s league meeting with Coventry, describing it as a “more important game”. The hosts are without injured trio Andreas Bjelland, Scott Hogan and Jota.Match pointer Walsall have managed to score only one goal in their past four FA Cup meetings with BrentfordBury v Bradford CityVenue Gigg Lane, Saturday 3pmRef Rob LewisOdds Bury 7-4 Bradford City 8-5 Draw 9-4Although Bradford’s manager, Phil Parkinson, said this “probably wasn’t the tie that either side wanted”, Bury have had to allocate extra space for away fans due to demand for tickets. With both clubs mid-table in League One, the chance of a Cup run and a big draw in the next round appears to have galvanised supporters.Match pointer Bradford have won the past three meetings in all competitions, including 2-1 in the league last OctoberCardiff City v Shrewsbury TownVenue Cardiff City Stadium, Sunday 6pm S4CRef Peter BankesOdds Cardiff City 4-5 Shrewsbury Town 4-1 Draw 5-2Russell Slade has quietly guided Cardiff to the fringes of the Championship play-off places and while a Premier League return will remain their priority this looks an eminently winnable tie for the 2008 finalists.

Luis Suárez suspended for two Copa del Rey matches over Espanyol insults
~~AUTHOR~~
Guardian sport
~CONTENTS~
Luis Suárez has been suspended for two Copa del Rey matches for insulting Barcelona’s city rivals Espanyol.The referee’s report for the heated cup match at Camp Nou that ended 4-1 for Barcelona on Wednesday said Suárez insulted Espanyol players in the tunnel after the match. Espanyol had two players sent off in the game.Lionel Messi inspires Barcelona to win over Espanyol on Arda Turan’s debut Read moreBarcelona said in a statement they would appeal against the ruling from the Spanish football federation, denying Suárez taunted his opponents. The sides play the return leg next week at Espanyol.Espanyol finished the tie with nine men after Hernán Pérez and Papakouli Diop were sent off, while there were accusations Pau López, the goalkeeper, stamped on Lionel Messi.According to the referee, Juan Martínez Munuera: “At the end of the game, once in the tunnel, Barça’s No9 Suárez, while the Espanyol players were coming up the stairs, waited for them and shouted at them on various occasions. He said: ‘I’m waiting for you, come here! You’re a waste of space’. It provoked a confrontation between players of both clubs and the security guards had to get involved, as did coaches of both teams.”Asked about the incident, the Barça coach, Luis Enrique, dismissed the accusation as “Christmas carols”, presumably in reference to the fact the match was being played on Día de Los Reyes (Three Kings’ Day). “It isn’t down to the coaches or the players to keep the peace,” he added. “It’s down to the referees to ensure we play football and not American football. There was some tension. I’d like it if there were more football, fewer interruptions and no injuries. When someone oversteps the mark, it’s down to the referees to keep order. Of course there’s tension in these games. The players know each other, they’re two teams with a special rivalry but that rivalry has to remain positive.”Diop insisted the Uruguayan striker should have been sent off as well. “We both insulted each other. He said swear words to me, and me to him, and I get sent off. The referee told me he didn’t hear us both, only me,” Diop told Carrusel Deportivo. “[The press] have spent all week saying we are violent and this has had its effect. [Barcelona’s players] are really good and if you cannot even touch them, they can do what they want. You cannot say we were violent. There wasn’t any blood – if we had wanted to, the Barça players would have gone off on stretchers.”Espanyol received eight yellow cards and two reds during the match, although Andrés Iniesta dismissed suggestions things had gone over the top. “Violence is a very strong word, in games like this there’s a lot of rivalry and contact,” he said.In further fallout between the two sides, the Spanish league said it would be sending a report denouncing racist and abusive language by fans during Espanyol’s home La Liga match against Barcelona last Saturday to the government’s anti-violence committee for sports.The league said in a statement it will condemn racist slurs directed toward Barcelona’s Brazilian striker Neymar and abusive chants against the club. It said they broke the Spanish football federation’s disciplinary code, which prohibits chants that “incite violence, racism, xenophobia and intolerance in sports”.

Zinedine Zidane: the No10 overcomes his doubts to step into Real Madrid cauldron
~~AUTHOR~~

~CONTENTS~
“I spent four years telling him he was a good header of the ball and every time he replied: ‘No, I’m not,’” says Pierrot Labat, a celebrated and long-serving coach at Bordeaux where, over two decades ago, he nurtured a young Zinedine Zidane. “On his first appearance for France, which was here in Bordeaux, he scored with a header and when he scored another two in the World Cup final I was in the stands again, crying my eyes out. You see, with him my work was always more psychological than technical because, like many exceptionally gifted people, he doubts a lot. He needs to prove things to himself. But when he talked for the first time about his ambitions to become a manager, back in 2012, I told him straight away that he had the qualities to be a very successful one. I think he is going to become the Alex Ferguson of Real Madrid.”Football Weekly Extra: the FA Cup third round, Zinedine Zidane steps up and more Read moreTime will tell on that one. But, to tweak Laozi, a reign of 1,500 matches starts with a single game and the journey of Zidane the first-team gaffer begins on Saturday when Real Madrid host Deportivo la Coruña. It has taken a while for Zidane to make this first step, partially because he doubted a lot.As a player Zidane often said that a future in the dugout held little appeal. It was not until six years after his retirement that he declared that he would pursue a career in management. He was 40. By that age Michel Platini, the only French player of comparable status to Zidane and who went into management straight after retiring, had backed out of it, quitting as national team boss at 37 after failure at Euro 92 and shifting instead into the sport’s nebulous administrative and political sector, which he seemed to find more comfortable. Until recently.It seemed that Zidane did not commit to management until he grew bored, not least of a shallow ambassadorial role at Real Madrid. Those who know him well believe he just needed time to prove to himself that, as Labat puts it, “he really wanted to learn how to help others to express his vision of the game”. Those people reckon he will be a manager of conviction, that he is in it for the long haul.“You can only succeed as a manager if you really want to do it and I know from being with him over the last couple of years that he really does, and he has done his utmost to achieve it,” says Guy Lacombe, who was manager at AS Cannes when Zidane was a teenage trainee there and is an instructor at the French Football Federation’s Direction Technique Nationale, a position that led to him renewing acquaintances with Zidane two years ago, this time as a tutor helping the former player to become a fully qualified coach.“It’s funny how life brought us back together after so many years,” says Lacombe, who has also managed Paris Saint-Germain and Monaco. “I found that he has the same qualities now that he had when I first met him. Above all, he is a simple person despite the immense aura that he now has in the football world. He is reserved and only speaks when he has something to say. But he is very attentive and really listens to people.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Zinedine Zidane, here coaching Real Madrid Castilla, ‘really wanted to learn how to help others to express his vision of the game,’ according to Pierrot Labat, who nurtured him at Bordeaux. Photograph: Gerard Julien/AFP/Getty Images“As his tutor I saw a lot of him and went to Madrid three or four times to observe his sessions with the Castilla [Real’s B team, which Zidane ran for a year and a half before replacing Rafael Benítez at the head of the senior team this week]. He has really taken on the mantle of manager. We discussed technical things but I only gave him one piece of advice, which is the same I give to all managers: stay true to yourself and follow your instinct. Being a manager is about making decisions, so listen to that voice inside you and let it take the decisions. I don’t have any worries on that front for Zinedine.”What, then, are Zidane’s instincts as a manager? During his studies, which culminated in him earning his Uefa Pro Licence last May, he watched Pep Guardiola’s sessions at Bayern Munich but did most of his course work in France, showing particular interest in the methods of the then Marseille manager, Marcelo Bielsa, and, most of all, Christian Gourcuff, now manager of Algeria but who is acclaimed mainly for his work during 11 years at Lorient where he created slick, attacking sides on a shoestring budget. Zidane appreciates that style, though financial constraints are not something he cares to replicate which is why he rejected an offer in 2014 to begin his managerial career back at Bordeaux. Money should not be a problem at Real and his preferred style, if he can produce it, will be just what the Santiago Bernabéu crowd have been ordering.But will he produce it? That will require forming a balanced team and taming oversized egos. Because of his imagination as a player Zidane has been hailed as the antidote to the caution of Benítez but he is unlikely to prescribe a populist, all-guns-blazing approach. As a player he stressed that he was only able to perform his magic because of the stage-building craft of Claude Makélélé, whose sale by Madrid to Chelsea he decried as the blunder that brought about the demise of the first galácticos era, memorably quipping that flogging Makelele and then buying David Beckham was tantamount to putting “another layer of gold paint on the Bentley when you are losing the entire engine”. Zidane probably noted more recently that Bielsa’s reign at Marseille unravelled when the Argentinian became overwhelmed by attack-lust and spurned defensive midfielders.Fitting all Real’s forwards into the lineup could be self-destructive, yet leaving any of them out risks polluting the atmosphere and, of course, flouting the policy of the president, Florentino Pérez. Zidane confirmed at his opening press conference that he would start Cristiano Ronaldo, Karim Benzema and Gareth Bale, but was vaguer about James Rodríguez and Isco and, indeed, did not specify the positions the other three will play. Will Bale retain the central role he enjoyed under Benítez? If Zidane believes the Welshman is more use on the wing, will Bale conclude that he is better off at another club?Zidane is going to have to come across as a convincing negotiator in the dressing room. At least he will benefit from more legitimacy than Benítez did. Some players with very definite notions of how they should play were scornful of his right to issue instructions to the contrary, nicknaming him The No10 as a sarcastic snipe at his own insignificant playing career. No one can belittle Zidane. He really is The No10.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Zinedine Zidane believes he has the nous to cajole players into doing what he requires: ‘You have to manipulate players a bit … carrot and stick.’ Photograph: Emilio Naranjo/EPAOne Castilla player spoke of Zidane’s magnetism and if his golden reputation does not carry enough weight in talks, then Zidane believes he has the nous to cajole or coerce players into doing what he requires, telling L’Equipe: “You have to manipulate players a bit … carrot and stick.”Lacombe says: “Over the years he, like all players, formed opinions of the personalities and exercises of various managers he worked under but when you are a player your opinion only relates to your own game, you do not have to have an overall picture like a manager does. Over the last two or three years that is all Zinedine has been thinking about: the team. Even though as a player he had all the qualities needed to bring the best out of others around him on the pitch, he still had to reflect on how he could do that from the sidelines. He has developed those qualities and can convey them now as a manager.”Zinedine Zidane tops popularity charts at Real Madrid | Sid Lowe Read moreZidane demonstrated at Castilla that he is strong enough to insist on team cohesion taking priority over individuals. He often left out Martin Odegaard, the Norwegian teenager signed last year amid much fanfare and on a far bigger salary than anyone else at Real’s B team. Odegaard trained with the first team and was expected to play for Castilla when made available, causing resentment among some players and leading Zidane to conclude the team would be best served by the side that had trained together all week. Odegaard was not pleased, nor was Pérez. Real’s president began to wonder, especially as Castilla’s performances were unconvincing for much of last season, whether he could rely on Zidane to serve his purposes at all.Muttering was even heard in the summer about Pérez preparing to ditch Zidane before deciding to keep him if only because, in the eyes of supporters, the Frenchman still emitted a stellar glow that reflected well on Pérez. According to that theory, Pérez would retain Zidane in a prominent but relatively innocuous position and certainly did not intend enthroning him as first-team king. But Benítez’s unpopularity became such that Pérez felt compelled to make a change this week and standing in Zidane’s way at that point would have risked enflaming anger at the president rather than countering it so Zidane may have emerged as even more powerful than his employer while Pérez may have manoeuvred himself into a precarious position. Perhaps Zidane is a skilled politician on top of everything else.Zidane is aware that the intrigue, the expectations and more media demands than even he has ever faced before mean he will have to keep cool and surround himself with allies whose loyalty is beyond doubt. His No2 was always going to be David Bettoni, who has been his friend since the pair were trainees at Cannes and is godfather to one of his children. Bettoni’s playing career did not amount to much but it did revolve around his illustrious friend’s, as after Zidane moved to Juventus in 1996, Bettoni left Cannes and spent the next five years at four different lower league clubs, all close to Turin. He later moved into coaching and was running Cannes’ Under-19 team when Zidane brought him to Castilla last year.“They really complement each other,” says the Cannes president, Pierre Cancian. “David is really demanding and meticulous, very aware that little details make big differences. He encourages a style of football a lot like that of Arsène Wenger, another great coach who started out at Cannes.”Bettoni, as part of his coaching education, completed a course in Switzerland in 2010 entitled Mastering Your Emotions. His support could help Zidane do just that.Zinedine Zidane's career at Real Madrid – in pictures Read more“I always told Zizou that without the people around him, especially his wife, Véronique, he would not have achieved all the feats that he has,” says Labat. “That support is crucial for him. I remember talking to Bixente Lizarazu about the headbutt at the 2006 World Cup and Liza said that if he had spoken to Zizou before the final, as he had done before the [last-16] match against Spain, he could have helped remove the tension that caused it. Zizou puts so much pressure on himself to do his maximum that he needs a circuit breaker to ensure there is no explosion and that is what the people close to him do for him.”On Saturday, at least, more than 81,000 adoring fans will be close to him when he sends a senior team out for the first time as manager. The demands at Real are unique but is there really anywhere better for Zidane to start? “Some say Zidane would have been wiser to start his managerial career at a small club but I lean towards the view that Real is the best possible place for him to begin,” says Lacombe. “To be a good manager you have first of all to be in the right place at the right time and Madrid is undoubtedly the right place for him.“Everyone was awaiting his appointment but all the pressure is on the president who appointed him. He knows the players very well from having worked with them in competitive situations while assistant to Carlo Ancelotti and by being always around the dressing room. That is an incredible advantage. Normally when you arrive as a manager in a club you know maybe two or three players, but not the whole squad. To have such a deep knowledge of his environment puts him in a great starting position. So the only question that remains is: ‘Is this the right time?’ I wholeheartedly hope so.”

Dagenham & Redbridge captain Joss Labadie: ‘I’m not this monster that everyone thinks I am’

Joss Labadie sits in his house in Essex, with his six-month-old son, Roman, sleeping peacefully on his chest. The Dagenham & Redbridge midfielder talks in gentle tones, partly so as not to disturb the newest member of his family but also because, off the field at least, he is a pretty laid-back guy.FA Cup third round: 10 ties to look out for this weekend Read moreThe serene picture jars with the public perception of him. Labadie knows what everybody thinks; that he is, to quote him, “this monster”. It is his cross to bear after the controversies that have stained his name. In each of the previous two seasons, Labadie has been found guilty by the Football Association of biting an opponent and banned.The world knows about Luis Suárez but, as a lower division journeyman, Labadie’s transgressions have largely drifted under the radar, even if there have been headlines about Labadie The Baddie and the League Two Suárez.The 25-year-old’s first offence came in February 2014, when he was at Torquay United and he was suspended for his club’s final 10 games of the season for biting Chesterfield’s Ollie Banks. The length of the FA ban was the same as that given to Suárez in April 2013, when he was a Liverpool player, for his bite on Chelsea’s Branislav Ivanovic.Labadie’s second punishment was heavier. He was suspended for six months for biting the finger of the Stevenage defender Ronnie Henry in Dagenham’s fixture at the Lamex Stadium in March 2015.Labadie made his comeback for Dagenham in October and he says on several occasions that the incidents are “all in the past now”; that he wants to move on and look to the future which, most tantalisingly, brings an FA Cup third-round visit to Everton on Saturday afternoon – one of the biggest games of his career. But Labadie’s past is not the kind to let go easily.

Photograph: Dave Simpson/TGSPHOTOWhen he opens up about it, the emotions tumble out. There has been frustration and sadness, fear, even – together with enormous gratitude to Dagenham for the way they have stood by him. At another club, Labadie might have lost it all. More than ever, he appreciates his life as a footballer. Above all, though, there is resentment; the sense he has been wronged. Because here is the thing: Labadie maintains he was innocent on both occasions.When an A-list star such as Suárez sinks his teeth into Ivanovic or Giorgio Chiellini, the pictures from every angle are carried around the world. It is there for all to see, and judge. At League Two level, it is different. The evidence is grainier and, as any defence counsel would point out, more circumstantial.“The evidence was inconclusive in both of my cases,” Labadie says. “In a court of law, it would have been laughed at. It would have been chucked out. This is football. The FA is different. I’m disappointed with the whole outcome but, as I say, it’s all in the past now. Whether I was wrongfully done or whatever, we can’t affect it. I’ve just got to move on.”Labadie peppers the dialogue with football speak. It feels like a defence mechanism. His accusers were more colourful. The then Stevenage manager Graham Westley said Henry had “nearly lost his finger”. Banks, the Chesterfield player, tweeted a photograph of his chest, which showed a deep red mark. “I can’t believe another human has taken a chunk out of my ribs in a football game!” Banks wrote. “Disgusting!”On at least one level, it came down to an ugly game of ‘He said, she said’. “I was disappointed that a fellow professional would do that,” Labadie says of Banks and the picture he tweeted. “That mark could have come from anything. You’re playing football. I’ve got marks every week.“It was just an incident that happened in the box. He has claimed that I did something that I didn’t. He showed a mark on his body and the FA have made their decision based on that, with no conclusive proof.”Labadie insists he did nothing wrong in the flashpoint with Henry, either, and the Dagenham managing director, Steve Thompson, is on record as saying that “on the balance of probability, we felt it was more of an accident than a deliberate act”. According to Thompson, Henry had put his finger inside Labadie’s mouth during a tussle.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Joss Labadie is grateful to Dagenham for standing by him. ‘It was hard to take, losing six months of playing time and you feel worthless,’ he says. Photograph: TGSPhoto/Rex/Shutterstock“Even the police officer [close to the incident] said he saw Joss’s head being pulled to one side,” Thompson has said. “So if you’ve got your finger in someone’s mouth and the other person’s head gets tugged, your finger is going to scrape against their teeth. That’s what we felt happened.”Labadie talks of having grown stronger, of feeling older and wiser than his years. With Dagenham’s new manager, John Still – who replaced Wayne Burnett in the days after Christmas – having left out the club captain, Andre Boucaud, Labadie has taken on the armband. Still has stressed the need for togetherness in what is a precarious situation. Dagenham sit 22nd in League Two, one place and two points above the relegation zone into non-league football. They have not won at home all season.“It was hard to take, losing six months of playing time and you feel worthless,” Labadie says. “But I owe everything to Dagenham, to Steve Thompson and Wayne Burnett. Without their support, I wouldn’t have been able to support my family; I’ve also got a 19-month-old daughter, Delilah.“I’m trying to repay them with my performances and I’ve just got to show the rest of the country I’m not a bad person, I’m not this monster everyone thinks I am. I’m sure, in time, that will happen.”

How Halifax Town were hypnotised into shocking Manchester City in the FA Cup
~~AUTHOR~~
Steven Pye
~CONTENTS~
It was probably the last thing that Malcolm Allison wanted. After spending big at the start of the 1979-80 season, the pressure was building on Manchester City’s manager as the new decade commenced, and a trip to Fourth Division Halifax Town in the third round of the FA Cup awaited as the vultures circled. Taking on an improving Halifax was bad enough, but for Allison the tie would also see him lock horns again with an old foe from the past. It didn’t just rain on Saturday January 5 for Allison; it well and truly poured.Sitting in 16th place in the top flight in January 1980, the City board and supporters expected more. In the previous summer Allison had been appointed manager, with Tony Book stepping up to General Manager. City had won the League Cup in 1976 and finished second in the league in 1976-77 under Book, so Allison’s appointment in July 1979 was a gamble by chairman Peter Swales. It was a decision he would come to regret.The club flexed their muscles in the transfer market in the summer of 1979, spending £750,000 on Michael Robinson, £300,000 on Bobby Shinton, £250,000 on Steve Mackenzie (making Mackenzie the most expensive teenager in Britain), and £140,000 on Yugoslav defender Dragoslav Stepanovic. But the deal that really stood out came in September, when City spent a whopping £1,437,500 on Wolves midfielder Steve Daley, a deal that in subsequent years would be guaranteed a spot in any article discussing worst signings ever.Money was recouped on the popular duo of Gary Owen and Peter Barnes, along with Dave Watson and Asa Hartford, yet, with so much investment in the squad, Allison was in the spotlight as the season kicked off. A poor start, in which they won one of their first six matches, saw the press sharpening their pens, but ten 10 from the next 12 steadied the ship (in the days of two points for a win).Inconsistency ruled into the New Year. A 4-0 loss at home to Liverpool was followed up two weeks later by a 2-0 derby win over Manchester United; three consecutive defeats, including a 4-0 thumping at Ipswich, saw the team drop to 18th, before a 3-0 home win over Derby and a 2-1 win at Everton stopped the rot, highlighting the Jekyll and Hyde nature of the team.Before their trip to Halifax, City lost 4-1 to struggling Brighton and started a slide down the table that saw Allison’s reign begin to unravel with the club not winning a league match until 12 April. But as poor as the loss on the south coast was, there was worse to come a week later, as Allison took his team to The Shay on an unforgettable afternoon for both clubs.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Malcolm Allison in happier days. Photograph: PAAfter being re-elected to the Football League in two of the last three seasons, Halifax were at least going the right way in 1979-80. Under the management of George Kirby, the club were in 11th position and had only lost one out of 13 at The Shay, their far from hospitable home. Kirby had enjoyed success in his previous spell at the club, finishing third in Division Three in 1970-71, and then beating Manchester United 2-1 in the pre-season Watney Cup, before defecting to Watford. For the Liverpool-born Kirby, January 1980 would provide another opportunity to get one over a Mancunian rival.The build-up to the match focused heavily on two men in particular. Allison was understandably under scrutiny, but when Kirby used an old adversary of Allison’s in an attempt to give his players an edge in the tie, the City boss was forced to share the column inches as the match approached. Allison had history with the hypnotist, Ronald Markham, who was more commonly known by his stage name Romark. In the 1975-76 season, Allison was managing Crystal Palace and had used the services of the hypnotist to boost the confidence of his players. Romark claimed he had never paid for the work and he was not a happy man.Hell hath no fury like a hypnotist scorned. Romark immediately placed a curse on Allison, even meeting up with Southampton boss Lawrie McMenemy the day before the 1976 FA Cup semi-final with Crystal Palace to give any support he could provide. Third Division Palace lost 2-0, and later missed out on promotion to Division Two. Whether or not you choose to believe in a curse is your choice, but Palace’s collapse in the league that season added intrigue to the tale.Romark met the Halifax players on the eve of the match, apparently hypnotising Paul Hendrie (father of future Aston Villa player Lee) and convincing him that he was the best midfielder in the country. Striker John Smith was sceptical about his meeting with Romark, telling the Lancashire Evening Post: “I was trying not to laugh and I’m thinking, what’s all this about? What a load of nonsense.”      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   The mighty Romark. Photograph: PAOne factor that obviously did help the Halifax players was the state of the playing surface on the day of the match. Smith thought this was more of a factor and admitted that his manager tried to make it as uncomfortable as possible for their more illustrious opponents: “It had snowed all week and by Thursday the pitch was ankle deep in water, thawing out slowly. Kirby, though, got the fire hoses on the pitch, and poured hundreds of gallons of extra water on. By kick-off, the pitch was just about playable, but it looked like a soggy, peat bog.”It may be a cliche to say that the Cup is a great leveller, but back in the 1980s it truly was. Pitches like the one seen at The Shay were ideal for Cup upsets, even if Division One teams were not as spoilt then as they are now with their own grounds. Referee Michael Lowe inspected the pitch twice on the morning of the match and deemed it fit. City’s players would have taken one step on to the mud that day and known they were in for a fight.City were also hindered by a lack of experience in their defence. Without Tommy Booth, Willie Donachie, Paul Futcher, and Stepanovic, Allison was forced to field three teenagers in his back four – Tommy Caton, Nicky Reid, and Ray Ranson – and the situation would have been even worse had it not been for a British postal strike. Booth and Ranson had been sent off in a friendly against Real Madrid in December, but due to a delay in receiving the match report, they both avoided suspension against Halifax. Booth missed out anyway, but there would be no such lucky escape for Ranson.The match kicked off and City were under the cosh immediately. A long throw from Mick Kennedy eventually found its way to Hendrie, who pulled his volley wide from six yards out. The tone for the afternoon had been set. Shortly after, an Andy Stafford corner was tipped on to the post by Joe Corrigan, the excitement building in the 12,599 crowd as the conditions worsened. It was becoming increasingly clear that this was not a day for pretty football.Have any teams ever attempted to harness psychic power? | The Knowledge Read moreGradually City began to impose themselves, with Halifax keeper John Kilner doing well to deny Shinton, and then parrying a volley from ex-Preston team mate Michael Robinson. But there was still a threat down the other end. Towards the end of the half Corrigan denied Halifax captain Dave Evans, a player who had once marked Johan Cruyff while playing for Aston Villa against Barcelona in the Uefa Cup. At half time, both managers would have been relatively happy.Looking at the middle part of the pitch it is amazing how a game of football could take place during the second half, as the mud seemed to expand and sap energy from the players. Hendrie went close again, bringing panic to the City goalmouth, but the best chance of the match fell to Shinton. A Dave Bennett cross, made from one of the rare patches of grass on the pitch, was nodded back across goal, the ball landing at the feet of the City striker on the six-yard line (not that anyone could see it). But Shinton’s instinctive strike was well saved by Kilner, and soon after Hendrie made City pay the ultimate price.On 75 minutes the decisive blow was landed. A Stafford cross from the left was superbly cushioned by Smith into the path of Hendrie and the midfielder found himself one-on-one with Corrigan. Hendrie’s confident left-footed finish would prove the difference, and as the Halifax players celebrated in front of the stunned City fans, Allison must have wanted a hole to swallow him up. Instead he had to sit in the tiniest dugout imaginable, watching as his expensive misfits tried in vain to repair the damage.Daley went close late on but, as if to sum up his City career, his long-range effort went past the post and that was that. As soon as the final whistle sounded, the celebrations and recriminations could begin. As Halifax’s players enjoyed champagne, their City counterparts endured a dressing down from Allison and were forced to take a long look at themselves.“Defeat will not be the end of the world, but it will be bloody close to it,” Allison had declared before the trip to Halifax. How true. According to the press, cries of “Allison out” and “Swales out” could be heard from the terraces, with Daley having to be restrained while getting on the team coach after receiving abuse from supporters. The situation at Manchester City was as messy as the pitch at The Shay.Swales described the experience as “the worst football day of my life,” but promised to support Allison and Book. “All I can do is give Malcolm and Tony our backing. I still believe they can do the job,” said Swales. He was true to his word. In March, more money was thrown at the problem, with £1.25m spent on Kevin Reeves as the panic buys continued. City avoided relegation but the writing was on the wall. No wins in the first 12 league matches of 1980-81 season left Swales with no option. Allison was sacked and replaced by John Bond. Halifax went on to lose in the fourth round at Bolton and finish 18th in the Fourth Division, with the City match very much the highlight of Kirby’s second spell at the club. Kirby was dismissed in June 1981 after the club had to re-apply for their league position once more. Hopefully he had the common sense to pay Romark in January 1980, otherwise people may have jumped to conclusions.How Christy O’Connor Jr became Europe's hero at the 1989 Ryder Cup Read moreAnd what of Romark? Happy to court the publicity, he announced that he would finally lift the curse on Allison, an invitation that was politely (or maybe not) turned down. Whether Romark had a positive influence on Halifax or not is debatable, but his presence certainly added an extra ingredient to the tie. “All the headlines, though, were about that hypnotist, but we beat Manchester City through courage, hard work and belief,” protested Smith. In truth, City were there for the taking, regardless of Romark.Martin Tyler neatly summed up the Halifax Cup shock in his Times report, writing that it had “every element of cup-tie football: the Fourth Division against the first; the poor of the league against the biggest spenders; a quagmire of a pitch in one of the game’s least fashionable settings.” It was the sort of occasion that seemed the norm back in the 1980s, as supporters of Harlow Town, York City,Port Vale and Sutton United can attest. Any City fan who went to Halifax that day and froze on the terraces, caked in mud, and embarrassed at the state of their club, fully deserves their moment of glory now. From Shinton to Sergio, life has rarely been dull if you follow Manchester City.• This blog first appeared on That 1980s Sports Blog• Follow Steven Pye on Twitter

Eastleigh’s Chris Todd targets FA Cup glory after battling back from cancer
~~AUTHOR~~
Alan Smith
~CONTENTS~
Chris Todd remembers the phone call as if it were yesterday. It was a typical midweek evening in November 2008 and life was about to change for ever. A rare strain of cancer had taken hold; unbeknown to him, he was living on borrowed time.FA Cup third round: 10 ties to look out for this weekend Read moreDespite warnings from medical professionals to get checked weeks earlier, he remained ignorant to the condition spreading rapidly inside. A nurse noted a problem with his blood after a routine groin operation but Todd did nothing apart from jest that he was seriously ill. Except it was not a joke: his spleen was expanding and the clock was ticking.The then 27-year-old had a severe stomach infection when recovering from that minor procedure but again failed to take the hint. He struggled for fitness upon returning to training at Torquay and one day he collapsed at his steering wheel. Luckily his car was stationary at a roundabout and it “triggered something in my mind” to get checked. He went for a blood test having trained as normal despite that brief loss of consciousness.That night, while sitting at home, the phone rang. “You have chronic myeloid leukaemia,” the nurse on the other end of the line said. In minutes Todd went from worrying about getting back on the pitch to thinking “my days are numbered”.But for that timely test the now Eastleigh manger would not be alive and preparing for the biggest day in the club’s history, Saturday’s FA Cup third-round tie at home to Bolton Wanderers. He is in remission, taking Gleevec, a form of oral chemotherapy, every day – “probably forever” – but appreciating life more than ever.“There’s a lot of emotion still because five years ago I didn’t expect to be here,” Todd says in the old-fashioned clubhouse at Eastleigh’s 5,200-capacity Silverlake Stadium. “All of a sudden I’m a manager with three beautiful kids, a wife and an amazing family around me. I couldn’t ask for any more.”Todd, an uncompromising defender, was back playing later that season and enjoyed a sweet ending by winning man of the match in Torquay’s Conference play-off final win over Cambridge at Wembley.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Chris Todd took over as manager at Eastleigh in September, initially as caretaker. ‘You’re never quite sure until you try something if you are going to enjoy it but I’m absolutely loving it,’ he says. Photograph: Mike Hewitt/Getty ImagesHe has fundraised relentlessly since, from writing a book – “it was therapeutic” – to singing in front of 3,000 people at the Royal Albert Hall. But Saturday’s meeting with Neil Lennon’s Championship strugglers may well be the highlight.“To look back and think of what I was experiencing in 2008 and to be standing next to Neil Lennon on the sideline in the third round – it is special,” Todd says. “I’ll be looking across and thinking: ‘This ain’t bad, I was watching him on the TV not so long ago.’ It means so much to me. It’s been an unbelievable ride and hopefully I can keep going.”He is at ease discussing his illness, advocating increased awareness in the male-driven environment he occupies, and above all making sure to enjoy each day. He reminds himself every morning that nothing should be taken for granted.“When I got the phone call, the first thing I did was go online to read about it. The stories were horrendous – people saying how bad it was, family members talking about their struggles. It was all negative and I got myself into a thought process of my days being numbered.“But once I got healthy again I thought I needed to let people know. I’m a sportsperson and people respect that and look up to you a little bit, so I wanted to give something back and tell people what it’s all about. There was also positivity from it – you can get better and live your life to the max. I’m doing that at the minute. Being through what I have, I know there is hope.”There were, however, days when optimism was hard to come by. Todd took to keeping a diary, subsequently self-publishing More than Football in the Blood in 2011 to fund research into a condition that is diagnosed around 600 times a year.“It was a therapeutic thing, to be honest. Every day I started writing down what I was feeling and going through. It was easier for me to put it down on paper than speak to somebody, and it led from that. One day my mum said I should use it as a book. So that helped to create awareness, and from there so many things happened.”Since, he has joined a choir, released a single, appeared on a Channel 4 documentary and starred in an independent film. Football, though, remained the overwhelming passion.After Torquay he joined Forest Green, via loan periods at Salisbury and Newport, before Eastleigh, at the time in Conference South, offered him a challenge he could not refuse in 2013. He has progressed from player to coach to assistant and, now, manager.When Richard Hill resigned fatigued in late September, Todd was installed as caretaker. A couple of wins later he was put in permanent charge despite 60 other applicants for the vacancy.The Hampshire club are full of ambition and their rookie manager has promised to take them to the Football League. When he signed as a player that was the aim; one promotion later he is determined to complete the job. He remains on a steep learning curve, though.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Eastleigh will have a sell-out crowd of 5,000 for the visit of Bolton Wanderers on Saturday. Photograph: Mike Hewitt/Getty Images“I experience something new every day but I’m absolutely loving it. It’s difficult. It’s not an easy job. I understand what managers go through now, but it’s something I’ve always wanted to do. You’re never quite sure until you try something if you are going to enjoy it but I’m absolutely loving it.”The dressing room dynamic also needed to change. No longer were his players allowed to call him “Toddy”, threatened with a fine if they referred to him by his nickname. From then on it was gaffer, leaving no doubt who was in charge. “When you first take over it’s strange having been a player but from day one they gave me respect,” he says. “They have taken everything on board. Without the players on your side, you are nothing as a manager.”The excitement in the leadup has been palpable but the No1 priority remains promotion from the National League to League Two. Results have been good since Todd took charge and Eastleigh are fourth.When Todd joined, crowds at Silverlake were around 500 but now the average gate nears 2,000. Although the Bolton tie is not the lucrative pay-day imagined by some, it is giving the club an unprecedented level of exposure. They expect to make a little under £100,000 but the game will be a sell-out.This is the first time since 1969 that only one non-league team have been left at this stage and so much points to an upset. Bolton will turn up beset by off-field struggles and with one win from 19 matches, facing a team buoyed by recent form. They will play on a pitch that last Saturday was not fit for purpose, forcing the postponement of their league fixture with Bromley, and prone to gale force winds.“The British public love an underdog,” Todd says. “They love seeing the unfancied team win and I’m sure everyone apart from the Bolton fans will be wanting the best for us. Anything can be achieved, but it will be difficult.”Either way Todd, used to navigating difficulties, will have reached another milestone eternally thankful to be alive.

Arsenal’s Alexis Sánchez will not make return against Liverpool

James Riach
~CONTENTS~
Arsène Wenger has said Alexis Sánchez will not be fit enough to return for Wednesday’s Premier League match at Liverpool, as Arsenal prepare to defend their FA Cup title against Sunderland.FA Cup third round: 10 ties to look out for this weekend Read moreWenger’s side play Sunderland at the Emirates on Saturday, with Sam Allardyce set to make changes to his team because of the midweek round of league fixtures next week, describing the schedule as “diabolical”.Arsenal will also make changes, with Mikel Arteta available. Sánchez, who sustained a hamstring injury against Norwich in November, is not yet ready to feature and Wenger said the earliest the Chilean will return is against Stoke on 17 January.“Everyone is available from last week,” said the manager. “Arteta is available and will be selected because he played 45 minutes on Tuesday with the Under-21s. Alexis is a bit short to be in the squad but is not far. Liverpool will come too soon as well. Maybe for Stoke.“We want to win every competition we participate in. The FA Cup is one of them, for us it is an important competition. Confidence is a global thing and you can’t really separate it from one competition to another. You want to feel as well that your team is ready for every single challenge and the FA Cup is one that matters to us.“The FA Cup is a great competition. I’m not sure that Sunderland will field a weaker a team. We take care of this competition like everybody does. Everybody dreams of winning the FA Cup. There may be some priorities at some stage of the season for some clubs who think they are in trouble and have to make these kinds of decisions, so they choose. We don’t because we have a big squad and we feel we are equipped to deal with all the competitions.”Wenger said the full-back Mathieu Debuchy will be allowed to leave on loan in the January transfer window. The French defender has made only seven appearances this season and the Aston Villa manager, Rémi Garde, has expressed an interest in the 30-year-old. Wenger said: “He has an opportunity to go but he has not been in touch with any club.”He also revealed Mohamed Elneny’s proposed transfer from Basel has become complicated but he still expects the midfielder to join. “We are working hard on it and hopefully in the next two or three days we will get to the end of it.”

Norwich sign Portuguese right-back Ivo Pinto from Dinamo Zagreb
~CONTENTS~
Norwich have announced the signing of the Portuguese right-back Ivo Pinto from Dinamo Zagreb for an undisclosed fee.Blackburn sign winger Elliott Bennett from Norwich City Read morePinto came through the Porto youth system, before having spells at Rio Ave and the Romanian club CFR Cluj before his move to Zagreb in 2013. The defender, who won the Croatian league title in 2014 and 2015, brings with him experience of Champions League football this season, having played for Dinamo against Arsenal and Bayern Munich. He has signed a three-and-a-half-year deal.“I’ve worked hard to arrive in the best league in the world, so this move means a lot to me,” Pinto told Norwich City TV. “English football is very fast and very intense for the whole game. That matches me well because my best qualities as a player are being fast and intense too.“I want to improve as a player and as a person. This is a fantastic country and I want to learn as much as I can from its footballing culture. I’m very excited to come here and play for a big club in the Premier League, now I’m looking forward to starting work to help the team achieve their goals.”The Norwich manager, Alex Neil, believes Pinto will add depth to his squad, who are six points above the relegation zone and host Manchester City in the FA Cup on Saturday. “He’s a Portuguese Under-21 international and at only 26 has his best years ahead of him,” said Neil. “He is an athletic and good defender and will bring us options at the back.”

Golden Goal: Wayne Rooney for Everton v Arsenal (2002)
~~AUTHOR~~
Lawrence Ostlere
~CONTENTS~
May 2001 was a turning point for Arsenal. They had lost the FA Cup final 2-1 to Liverpool, when the terrifying pace of a young Michael Owen had magnified a weakness in Arsène Wenger’s defence. A week later their season petered out altogether with a 3-2 defeat at Southampton as they succumbed to Matt Le Tissier’s late winner, the final goal at The Dell. Wenger would spend much of the summer prising Sol Campbell from Tottenham as the manager set about rectifying his squad’s flaws and moulding the next Premier League champions. After Southampton, Arsenal would not lose another league match on the road for 17 months, until a 16-year-old from Croxteth spectacularly thumped one in off the bar.Golden Goal: Gabriel Batistuta for Fiorentina v Arsenal (1999) | Rob Smyth Read moreIf you can remember a world where Wenger signed players with the express ambition of winning the league, you may also be able to picture a fresh-faced David Moyes. In March 2002, as Wenger closed in on his first title since 1998, a different sort of transformation was beginning at Goodison Park with the appointment of their highly-regarded new manager. Everton would enjoy a period of remarkable stability and over-achievement under the Glaswegian.On arrival Moyes had talked passionately about the city of Liverpool, about moving to a place not unlike his home city. “I am joining the people’s football club,” the then 38-year-old proclaimed. “The majority of people you meet on the street are Everton fans.” And perhaps he saw his roots in a teenage Wayne Rooney, a working-class kid he would later describe as “the last of the classic street footballers.”Moyes certainly saw sheer, unfettered talent. He says it was actually a mesmerising solo performance against Leeds United two weeks after beating Arsenal that truly convinced him Rooney was going right to the very top, as Harry Redknapp would put it, but he also pinpoints an earlier moment when he and his coaching staff first realised they had an exceptional player.In one of Rooney’s first training sessions with the senior side, the forward picked up the ball close to the byline, stepped away from a defender and flighted a delicious chip into the far corner. “All the staff were watching and you could see them all look up the line at each other,” Moyes remembers. “They all had the same look on their face: Did you see that? Did that really happen? Everyone turned and looked. No one shouted: ‘What a goal!’ Maybe everyone was wondering whether he really meant it. But he did. From that moment we were all thinking: ‘Wow, what a player. What a player we have.’”Keeping the lid on      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   David Moyes was cautious with Wayne Rooney in the striker’s debut season, mainly using him from the bench. Photograph: Tom Jenkins for the GuardianOn the opening day of the 2002-03 season Everton hosted Tottenham, and Moyes decided to give Rooney his debut from the start. For most it was their first glimpse. The away fans gave him plenty of stick, chanting: “Who are ya?” whenever the stocky teenager touched the ball (It made a mark. Rooney wrote in his first book: “They don’t sing that at me anymore. They just boo and chuck abuse and slag me off instead. Funny that.”)Moyes kept his wonderkid out of the spotlight in the following weeks, using Rooney mostly as a substitute. He would come on with 20 or 30 minutes to go, play well with an assist here and there, as well as the odd yellow card for a meat-cleaver tackle or insulting the officials – at least Moyes knew he wasn’t shy. Then, on 1 October, Everton played Wrexham away in the League Cup. Rooney came off the bench and scored twice through the goalkeeper’s legs in a 3-0 win to become the then youngest goalscorer in Everton’s history. Rooney had arrived and Moyes couldn’t keep the lid on much longer.Two and a half weeks later, Arsenal came to Goodison. The champions were top of the table after seven wins and two draws and hadn’t been beaten in 30 league games. This was now a formidable Wenger team in which Freddie Ljungberg buzzed around Dennis Bergkamp, Thierry Henry led the line and Patrick Vieira roamed in front of a rearmoured defence led by Campbell.The days before, however, had been catastrophic for one Arsenal player. England were playing Macedonia in a Euro 2004 qualifier at St Mary’s, and after 11 minutes the visitors won a corner. Artim Sakiri delivered a devilish inswinger with his left foot. It went flat and hard over the six-yard-box rabble before bending back and homing in on the top of David Seaman’s far post, and rebounding into his net. Looking back it was nigh on unsavable but Seaman was pilloried nonetheless. It probably didn’t help that he’d been bamboozled a few months earlier in similar fashion during the World Cup quarter-final. The press came down hard and it would be his final international game.Because of the national debate over his England place, Seaman came into the Everton match under great scrutiny – despite Arsenal’s form – so when he flapped at Mark Pembridge’s early corner the Goodison crowd let him know about it. A few moments later they were silenced. David Weir slipped in his own six-yard box making a mess of a clearance, and Ljungberg reacted first to slot into the empty net and give Arsenal a seventh-minute lead.Everton responded well and were level 15 minutes later when Lee Carsley’s shot clattered a post and fell to Tomasz Radzinski. The forward jinked away from Pascal Cygan before beating Seaman to equalise, and it stayed 1-1 until the break. Arsenal dominated the second half; Wenger brought on Sylvain Wiltord who hit the upright, and Henry and Ljungberg both had clear sights of goal but missed the target. Goodison was getting anxious. After 80 minutes, Moyes turned to Rooney.His first action was to harass Campbell into giving up the ball. The fans were lifted by his enthusiasm but it was still Arsenal making chances. Another went by, Wiltord firing over the bar. Then, as the clock ticked over 90 minutes, Richard Wright thumped a goalkick downfield and Campbell headed it back to the halfway line. As the ball fell to Thomas Gravesen and he hooked it on, there was no indication of what was to come, that Arsenal’s unbeaten streak would be over in four teenage touches of a football.‘Fancies his chances …’      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Rooney spins towards goal with his second touch as Lauren and Arsenal back off. Photograph: Shaun Botterill/Getty Images“Rooney. Instant control,” says Clive Tyldesley on the commentary as the forward plucks the ball out of the sky with his first touch, 40 yards out. Aware of Lauren backtracking, he pulls the ball away from goal and uses his second touch to spin himself almost 360 degrees back towards Arsenal’s retreating defence. Kevin Campbell never gets the memo. Had he known what Rooney had in his mind, Campbell would probably have stood hands on hips ready to ball out the cocky sod for not playing in the senior pro. Instead, Campbell senses an opportunity and bursts into the inside left channel. Just as he reaches the gap between Lauren and Sol Campbell, he glances back over his right shoulder – one fast pass and I’m in – to see a wilfully oblivious Rooney knock the ball a few yards ahead for himself. Campbell can’t hold his run and sprints offside but his surge has pinned Arsenal’s defence back a crucial yard.Rooney accelerates after his third touch and glances up. For a boy to shoot from here, against the champions, this must be confidence, an instinctive all-consuming surge of self-belief, built by those League Cup goals against Wrexham and hundreds of youth goals; and in the park, on the streets and up against the shutters of the nursery opposite his parents’ house.Suddenly he slows down, eyes momentarily transfixed on the goal. Sol Campbell and Lauren both realise he is about to attempt something audacious. As Rooney raises his left arm towards the clouds and wraps his right foot across the ball, so does Tyldesley, sounding a smidgen put-out by the insolence of it all: “Fancies his chances … !”       Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Thierry Henry congratulates Rooney at the end of the match. Photograph: Mike Egerton/EmpicsThe technique is exquisite. Rooney lands on both feet and in the brief moment the ball takes to curl around Campbell’s outstretched leg and reach the crossbar, he simply watches like the rest of us. Seaman throws up his left hand but Rooney has found the tiniest corridor of certainty, an inch above the goalkeeper’s glove. There is some universally shared satisfaction about goals that hit the underside of the bar. Perhaps it’s the moment all doubt is emphatically extinguished as a spread-eagled goalkeeper looks back, still hopeful he can scoop the ball to safety, only to see it spring into the net with an extra jolt of power. Goals off the bar don’t only cross the line, they sprint into the endzone and dance all over it.“Oh, brilliant goal! A brilliant goal!” shrieks Tyldesley as the ball crashes home. As Rooney sprints away what must he be thinking? He is not yet a signed-up professional, still on £75 per week, the work-experience boy strolling into the office, ripping the lid off a USB stick with his teeth and giving a groundbreaking presentation on how to increase productivity by 40%. Maybe he is thinking about how best to celebrate. Do I jump, do I punch the air, do I stand and soak it all up? In the end he does a bit of all three.On the sideline Moyes gives a hop, skip and jump of his own back to the dugout. The Premier League has a new youngest goalscorer, and he has done it against the champions with nonchalance. “Remember the name: Wayne Rooney!” The 16-year-old who had fancied his chances would go on to render that advice rather redundant.

Click to enlarge and debate the strip below the line.Keith Hackett’s verdict1) No doubt plenty of my former colleagues might have mixed feelings about this one – but play it straight. You can’t ignore this: you’ve witnessed the manager striking another person off the field of play, so if he does return to his technical area, dismiss him for misconduct. Otherwise it’s a matter for the police and security staff. Include full details in your post-match report – and, if you had to stop the game to take action, restart with a dropped ball. Thanks to Rad Kaplan. 2) It’s a corner. The goalkeeper rightly tried to avoid handling the ball from the deliberate back pass – he only intervened with his hand in a second phase of play, after the ball had rebounded off the post. It’s a great scenario, that shows how alert and quick-thinking you have to be. Harry Pollitt, age 12, wins the shirt. 3) The substitution was completed and play had restarted: you cannot reverse it now. The team should have noticed what was happening, and a mistake by your colleague does not nullify the change. Fortunately this shouldn’t be possible in England because of the way substitutions are handled: both teams have to submit forms to identify in writing the name and number of the player coming on and going off.

Football transfer rumours: Romelu Lukaku to Manchester United?
~~AUTHOR~~
Simon Burnton
~CONTENTS~
Manchester United’s ace scouts have identified a striker who can score goals in the Premier League! And it’s Romelu Lukaku, who has scored 16 goals in his last 14 Premier League games. Excellent scouting, lads. Really, great stuff. The Mirror exclusively reveal this morning that Louis van Gaal is ready to green light a £40m bid for the Everton frontman.Not only that, the very same crack team of scouting wizards have found just the man to create chances for him! And it’s Eden Hazard, reigning Premier League Player of the Season. Excellent scouting, lads. Really, brilliant stuff. The Star exclusively now say that United are “plotting a £65m raid” for the Chelsea ace, and that “the Glazer family have given the green light” to set the wheels in motion. Robert Martínez: no verbal agreement with Everton stars about summer exits Read moreChelsea fans should relax, though, because their own scouts have identified the perfect replacement for the Belgian, should the wasn’t-he-good-once Belgian makes a mooted summer move to Real Madrid, Bayern Munich or Paris St-Germain, if not Old Trafford – and they didn’t have to go very far to find him either: he’s Arsenal’s Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, of whom the Sun asserts that “there is a feeling he needs a new challenge”. The Mail reveals that Chelsea also have their eyes on another creative forward, in the shape of Barcelona’s Dutch-born Xavi Simons, though fans might be advised not to get too excited as yet: Simons is 12. Back to Manchester United, though, and Lazio have informed them they can have Felipe Anderson if they want – so long as they pay out a full £36m for the attacking midfielder. Asked about the possible transfer their coach, Stefano Pioli, said “it is up to the board to make decisions in the market”, which doesn’t really help very much but certainly isn’t a denial, and at least the rumour suggests that United’s scouts do more than just watch Match of the Day and sleep a lot. Charles N’Zogbia looks to be on his way to Greece, with Aston Villa manager Rémi Garde admitting he has “had some phone calls from an Athens club” and his AEK counterpart, Gus Poyet, saying “yes, we have chances to sign him”. The Sun estimates that N’Zogbia, now 29, has cost the Villains £5m per goal since his 2011 move from Wigan and label him the “costliest transfer blunder in Villa’s 141-year history”, and it certainly makes a refreshing change for Greeks to be able to have a giggle at English financial incompetence. Stoke City weigh up making bid for West Brom’s Saido Berahino Read moreDortmund’s Pierre-Emerick Aubamayang was asked whether he wants to move to Arsenal. “I don’t want to go to Arsenal,” he said. So that’s that. Talking of strikers who are going nowhere, Quique Sanchez Flores insists it is “impossible” that either Troy Deeney or Odion Ighalo will leave Watford this month. The Spaniard should give a lesson in rumour-dampening to Slaven Bilic, who has issued the world’s least convincing hands-off warning over Andy Carroll. “Do we want to sell him? I’ll tell you directly: no we don’t,” the West Ham manager sniffed. “But there are many ifs, many ifs. Every player has his price, even Messi or Ronaldo. So it goes for Andy as well.” In other words, come and get him. Liverpool are ready to break their transfer record to bring in £37m-rated Mönchengladbach midfielder Granit Xhaka, who is also on Arsenal’s radar. “Several big clubs are interested,” said his father and agent, Ragip. “Everything is possible, we’re not ruling anything out.” Also not ruling anything out is Mark Hughes, who has admitted that “there are lots of names getting bandied around” as Stoke discuss potential January transfers, and that Porto’s Giannelli Imbula is “one of them”. Benik Afobe is likely to end up at Bournemouth rather than any of his suite of rival suitors, who include Norwich, Crystal Palace and Derby, if only because they’re the only club willing to meet Wolves’ £12m asking price (though Palace probably don’t want him anyway, what with Alan Pardew raging that “I have seen all the names linked with us and not one of them is true”). And then when they’ve done that, they’ll move for QPR’s Steven Caulker, who is desperate to end his half-season of on-loan irrelevance at Southampton, and Rob Green, who if he remains at Loftus Road will soon be dropped so Rangers can avoid triggering an automatic contract extension clause, before testing Leeds’s resolve to keep Sam Byram, of whom Massimo Cellino says: “We won’t sell him, but he wants to leave.” Cardiff have slapped a £10m price tag on goalkeeper David Marshall, much to the disappointment of Everton, who had quite fancied signing him. Brighton are battling Wolves over £1.5m Chesterfield midfielder and captain Sam Morsy, while Birmingham are weighing up a £2m move for Peterborough’s goal-hungry striker Conor Washington – and might pick up his team-mate Marcus Maddison while they’re there. When they pick up the Mail they might be disappointed to discover that Reading are ready to pay £3m for the very same hot-shot forward.

FA Cup third round: 10 ties to look out for this weekend

~CONTENTS~
1) Eastleigh wave non-league flag against BoltonPreviously best known for surviving leukaemia and subsequently being pecked to within an inch of his life by emus on Soccer AM while wearing a coat made from cabbage and biscuits in the name of charity, Eastleigh’s young Welsh manager Chris Todd has every right to fancy his Hampshire side’s chances of advancing to the fourth round at the expense of Bolton Wanderers. The only non-league side left in the competition, Eastleigh sit fourth in the Conference and have been bankrolled to the tune of £3m by their sugar daddy, Stewart Donald, in recent years. They number the former QPR winger Lee Cook and the ex-Nottingham Forest defender Dan Harding among their ranks, two players who won’t have come cheap. Of course Bolton Wanderers have plenty of Championship experience too, having played badly enough in the division this season to find themselves anchored to the bottom of the table as well as £173m in debt, the subject of a winding-up order from HM Revenue and Customs, under a transfer embargo and resigned to the possibility of having to sell their best players during this January window. These are dark times at the Macron Stadium on and off the pitch, with results poor and staff uncertain when or if they will next be paid. With securing Championship survival almost certainly a priority for Neil Lennon and his players, Eastleigh fans could be forgiven for being more expectant than hopeful of beating them in the compact environs of the 5,192-capacity Ten Acres and going into the draw for round Four. Barry Glendenning• Sachin Nakrani: what on earth has gone wrong at Bolton?• All the latest news from the ConferenceListen to the pod on the FA Cup2) Senseless timing mars famous night for ExeterIt ought to beggar belief that the powers that be have done their utmost to make an ordeal out of the most appealing tie in a draw short of traditional Cup romance. But here we are, and if it seems self-defeating that supporters of a competition whose lustre remains difficult to maintain are being actively inconvenienced then it is worth reminding ourselves that we should not be remotely surprised by now. It would be fascinating to hear the logic behind the BBC’s decision to move this fixture to 7.55pm on a Friday night – 90 minutes after the last train of the day departs Exeter St Davids station for the 250-mile journey to Liverpool – but that is the power broadcasters have. It will be a fine day when their requirements are drawn up with half a thought for matchgoing fans such as the 1,347 away supporters who will nonetheless make the trip. Liverpool should not require too much assistance in disposing of League Two opponents but asking them to fulfil this tie three days after a Tuesday night League Cup semi-final at Stoke City was surely not necessary, either.None of this grumbling should, of course, detract from a famous occasion for Exeter City and their excellent manager, Paul Tisdale. Their league form – four consecutive defeats – does not bode well for a surprise but they might just have caught Jürgen Klopp, who had to recall the almost-forgotten Tiago Ilori from his loan at Aston Villa this week to partly offset a lack of available centre-backs, and his team at a good time. St James Park will be rocking – a spectacle that should make good television. It is just a shame that little else seems to matter. Nick Ames• Klopp to field young, inexperienced Liverpool against Exeter• Puzzle-loving Oakley gives Exeter clues how to beat Liverpool      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Paul Tisdale: hat’s entertainment. Photograph: ProSports/Rex Shutterstock3) Aston Villa should go for broke to avoid a shockThis tie yells “shock” louder than most and perhaps Rémi Garde would be well advised to make good use of an early opportunity to experience belt-and-braces life in the Football League. Wycombe Wanderers, sixth in League Two, are still some way from meeting Aston Villa on a level playing field but Gareth Ainsworth has assembled an impressive side that will hope to bounce back from a home defeat to Morecambe last weekend. In Garry Thompson and Paul Hayes, Ainsworth could field a strikeforce with a combined age of 67, but Wycombe aim for a high-energy style and Villa supporters may as well hope their team enters into a similar spirit of things. It has all been downhill since Theo Walcott opened the scoring for Arsenal in the 40th minute of last season’s final; even if Wembley holds a few chastening memories, any respite from the weekly grind will seem like a relief at the moment. History should encourage them to go for goals: Villa made League Cup visits to Adams Park in 2003 and 2005, winning 5-0 and – incredibly – 8-3. NA• Cole completes free transfer to Coventry City from Aston Villa• Garde wants Arsenal’s Debuchy to join Aston Villa 4) Resting players has bitten Allardyce in the pastThe holders get their latest defence of the trophy underway and they do so in the knowledge that Sam Allardyce and Sunderland are not especially fixated on the prize. Allardyce has had a particularly talkative week but his proclamations about the FA Cup gave pause for thought. “Of course I’m going to make changes,” said Allardyce, pointing to the fact that Sunderland will play Swansea City on Wednesday as part of a full league programme. “If the Premier League decides to put a stupid fixture midweek when they don’t bloody need to, then I haven’t got much choice.”The Premier League would argue that it does bloody need to, with Euro 2016 among the factors truncating the domestic calendar, but Allardyce is far from wrong and this regrettable piece of scheduling provides a ready-made excuse for managers in need of Premier League points to give their bigger performers a weekend off. It would be wise for Sunderland fans to set expectations even lower than usual, then, although Allardyce might recall that it does not always pay to rest players in anticipation of future problems. Two years ago, the then-West Ham manager made nine changes – fielding the youngsters Seb Lletget, Dan Potts, Danny Whitehead, George Moncur and Callum Driver – for a third-round tie at Nottingham Forest, with a League Cup semi-final first leg against Manchester City just three days away. If a 5-0 defeat at the City Ground was not entirely unexpected; the 6-0 thumping when senior players returned at the Etihad was definitely not part of the masterplan. NA• Allardyce ready to rebuild Sunderland around Defoe• Wenger gives Arsenal injury update and rules Sánchez out   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest  Sam Allardyce ‘didn’t mean to upset’ Jürgen Klopp.5) A packed house could swell Oxford United’s hopesThings are looking up for Oxford United, who have sold out their 12,000-capacity Kassam Stadium for only the third time in its 15-year history with the prospect of bloodying a Premier League nose. Michael Appleton’s team are third in League Two and on course both for promotion and their highest position in 15 years. The midfielders Kemar Roofe and Liam Sercombe have scored 19 league goals between them and both – in particular the former West Brom youngster Roofe – are attracting covetous glances from elsewhere. Oxford pack a punch but they are stingy, too: they have conceded only eight times in 12 home games and Swansea City might have wished for an easier assignment before next Wednesday’s face-off with fellow relegation contenders Sunderland. The announcement that Alan Curtis will stay on as manager until the end of the season has provided a timely shot of stability (regardless of what it might suggest about the past month’s search for Garry Monk’s replacement) but it would not be a surprise if minds were elsewhere. The Kassam roar tends to drift out of the three-sided stadium and across the car park behind its open end, but perhaps it will be more audible than ever on Sunday lunchtime. NA• Napoli reject £14.1m Swansea bid for Italy’s Gabbiadini6) Cureton eyeing chance to put Everton to swordDagenham & Redbridge have led a charmed life in the previous two rounds of this year’s FA Cup. Despite trailing 2-0 after only seven minutes of their first round replay against Morecambe, they made it into the second round where they again needed a replay, not to mention extra-time, to get past lowly Whitehawk from English football’s sixth tier. The League Two club’s reward for these exertions is a trip to Goodison Park, where they will face an Everton team that have played twice since the Daggers stuck it to Exeter on 2 January, although it remains to be seen how many first team regulars Roberto Martínez fields considering his team has Premier League visits to Manchester City and Chelsea in the week ahead.One Dagenham & Redbridge player unlikely to be fazed by the prospect of lining up at Goodison Park is Jamie Cureton, even if, like most of his team-mates, the 40-year-old has never played there before. In his 22nd season as a professional footballer at his 14th club, the striker actually made his professional debut for Norwich City against Everton in 1994, but has stated that, despite all those miles on the clock, this is the biggest FA Cup match of his life. “There aren’t many grounds I haven’t played at and before the draw I was looking at that and thinking what a great draw Everton would be,” he said. “It’s another one to cross off the list.” One could be forgiven for presuming Dagenham & Redbridge would have a better chance of beating their Premier League opposition if they were entertaining them at Victoria Road, but having failed to win a single league game there all season they may well prefer their chances of notching up victory on the road. BG• Still back at Dagenham for challenging third stint as manager• Besic, the cultured scrapper who could turn out to be an Everton gem      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Dagenham & Redbridge Ayo Obileye’s celebrates scoring his side’s third goal against Whitehawk. Photograph: Steve Paston/PA7) FA Cup can provide Chelsea with sole chance of trophyImagine the fun that could have been had with this fixture a few short weeks ago. The Twitter memes, the arch comments pondering whether Chelsea – Chelsea, get it? – could pull off an almighty third-round upset. There is less to wisecrack about now: Chelsea have, at last, strung together a run of improved form in the Premier League and their relentlessly efficient old ways might just be returning under Guus Hiddink. With neither relegation nor a Champions League place looking realistic, a concerted tilt at the FA Cup might hold particular appeal and it would certainly put a few noses out of joint if, given their fortunes so far, Chelsea emerged from this season with one more trophy than many of their rivals. What hope, then, for Mark Robins’ Scunthorpe United, who visit Stamford Bridge for the first time since a 3-1 third-round defeat in 2005? There is always Bradford’s stunning 4-2 victory last January, which in retrospect was a harbinger for the lack of care prevalent in the first half of Chelsea’s 2015-16. Another reverse against League One opponents would appear unlikely, but Chelsea must still treat hurdles like this seriously if their recovery is to gather pace. NA• Costa and Oscar separated after Chelsea training confrontation• Win (home) tickets to Chelsea v West Bromwich Albion      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   There were issues on the training ground between Oscar and Diego Costa. Photograph: Stefan Wermuth/Reuters8) Spurs v Leicester City a prequel to a Premier League showdownIt is a quirk of the fixture list that this encounter will be repeated a mere three days later, when Leicester City return to White Hart Lane – if they see any point in leaving at all – for a Premier League match. And not just any Premier League match: few could have predicted that these two would both be strongly involved in the title race at the season’s midway point, so it remains to be seen whether Sunday’s meeting sees a bout of shadow puppetry or a full-scale removal of the gloves. Mauricio Pochettino has resisted wholesale changes in cup competitions so far this term, citing a better knowledge of his players’ fitness than in his first season, and if the league title looks up for grabs it is also fair to say that any Premier League side that treats the FA Cup diligently stands a decent chance of being rewarded, too.Leicester will certainly break to some degree from the formula that has served them so spectacularly in recent months – Jamie Vardy will miss out through injury and Claudio Ranieri will probably rest others to minimise the chances of their minor stutter becoming anything worse – and probably run more risk of overstretching through battle on multiple fronts. One sure thing is that neither manager will be interested in prolonging the argument: expect this one to be settled entertainingly on the day, with the victor having sharpened their appetite by seeing off a credible rival for the trophy. NA• Riyad Mahrez: The Gallery • Spurs on verge of signing teenager Shilow Tracey from Ebbsfleet9) Big spending Derby County there to be shot atHartlepool United were on the end of a major shock last season when Blyth Spartans, of the Northern Premier League, beat them at Victoria Park in the second round. More of the same seemed on the cards when Salford City, non-league darlings du jour, travelled to the north-east in December but Ronnie Moore’s team narrowly prevailed after a replay and can now look forward to receiving opponents whom there is rather less pressure to defeat.Derby County are certainly there to be shot at: the recent signings of Nick Blackman and Abdoul Camara brought the Championship side’s spend on transfer fees alone this season up to around £26m and they are leaving little to chance in their pursuit of promotion to the Premier League. Their one-point advantage over third-placed Hull is not something Paul Clement and company will want to let slip after that kind of outlay; Hartlepool, then, will be eager to capitalise if Derby’s focus wavers and in the 19-year-old midfielder Brad Walker they have a talent who is surely not much longer for the lower reaches of League Two. The home team will need a significant improvement on their recent form, though. They have lost their last four league games and the danger is that Derby – bankrolled by Mel Morris, whose company, King, created the Candy Crush video game – will resemble kids in a sweet shop. NA• Karanka and Clement, the former Madrid No2s, share No1 aim      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Scott Fenwick puts Hartlepool ahead in extra-time against Salford, helping them on their way to a third-round meeting with Derby. Photograph: Alex Livesey/Getty Images10) Championship contenders will have focus elsewhere“The money they have spent already is a statement of intent; some of the sums Championship clubs are paying are astronomical.” So said Sean Dyche shortly before his Burnley team resumed life in the second tier following their relegation from the Premier League. He was speaking with particular reference to Middlesbrough and Derby County, who currently occupy first and second place in Championship, while his own Burnley team are reasonably poised back in fifth, 10 points off the pace-setters. With so much money up for grabs just for being in the Premier League next season, it’s difficult to imagine anyone at Middlesbrough or Burnley giving even a single hoot about the outcome of their match at the Riverside, as long as promotion remains a possibility. Any sort of FA Cup run for either team would be a distraction, but not by any means one that is welcome. BG

Monaco decide injured Radamel Falcao can stay at Chelsea
~CONTENTS~
The Chelsea striker Radamel Falcao looks set to stay at Stamford Bridge for the rest of the season after Monaco ruled out taking him back early.The Colombian is on loan from the Ligue 1 club but has struggled to make a notable contribution since José Mourinho brought him in during the summer.Falcao has not featured at all since the end of October because of a thigh injury, on which he underwent checks at Monaco’s training ground this week.Monaco believe he faces an extended spell out of action, meaning recalling him to the Stade Louis II is not an appealing option.The Monaco vice-president Vadim Vasilyev said in an interview on the club’s DailyMotion page: “Falcao is currently injured. He has six to eight weeks to go like that. We have decided not to take him back to Monaco for the moment.”Halfway through a season-long loan with Chelsea, the former Atletico Madrid striker has scored only one goal. He went through a similar goal drought while at Manchester United last season.With Diego Costa and Loïc Rémy ahead of him in the pecking order even a fit Falcao would appear unlikely to get much playing time with Chelsea for the rest of the season.Press Association Sport understands Falcao recently rejected approaches from Mexican and Turkish clubs.His contract with Monaco expires in 2018. Monaco signed the striker from Atlético in 2013 but he spent just one season in Ligue 1, suffering a major knee injury midway through it, before embarking on a disappointing loan spell at Old Trafford.

Callum Paterson’s early header gave Hearts their first Scottish Cup goal since 2012 and a fourth-round victory over Aberdeen.Hearts completely dominated the first half at Tynecastle and were good value for their 1-0 win but Andrew Considine squandered a glorious chance to level midway through the second period and the visitors pressed hard in a thrilling finale.Aberdeen’s Premiership title hopes also took a blow when Willo Flood followed fellow central midfielder Ryan Jack in suffering a hamstring injury.There were a little more than two minutes gone when Hearts capitalised on the first of their nine first-half corners.Alim Öztürk headed Sam Nicholson’s deep left-wing delivery towards goal and Paterson nodded into the top corner from close range.It was his team’s first goal in the competition since their 5-1 final thrashing of Hibernian and they looked determined to ensure the next followed quickly, giving Aberdeen a torrid time.The visitors were all over the place. Osman Sow was causing numerous problems and Mark Reynolds was booked for hauling Sow down after being turned 30 yards out.The defending got more desperate and Kenny McLean sent an attempted clearance back inside his own box to give Hearts another chance before goalkeeper Danny Ward let slip of the ball, but Blazej Augustyn could only hit the side-netting.Aberdeen switched to five at the back and settled down but Hearts were looking solid and Nicholson had a shot saved on the break before the hosts launched another series of corners, one of which saw McLean clear Augustyn’s header off the line.Things got even worse for the Dons seconds later when Flood hobbled off. Peter Pawlett came on and Graeme Shinnie moved back into central midfield as Derek McInnes reverted to a 4-2-3-1 formation.Aberdeen striker Adam Rooney showed his frustration with a blatant push and both he and Igor Rossi were booked. Tempers remained frayed after the break and McInnes reacted angrily to counterpart Robbie Neilson’s calls for referee John Beaton to take further action after a Shinnie foul.Öztürk had a free-kick saved before the Hearts skipper escaped a penalty claim when Rooney and 3,500 visiting fans behind the goal claimed he had pulled the Irishman.Aberdeen started to exert pressure and both McLean and Rooney failed to make the most of half-chances before the unmarked Considine missed the target from six yards after Jonny Hayes’ shot fell into his path.Sow came close on the break three times as Aberdeen left themselves more exposed but Hearts came under intense late pressure and Alexander made good stops from Niall McGinn and Ash Taylor.

England’s lost boy John Lundstram back to his best at ambitious Oxford
~~AUTHOR~~
Paul Doyle
~CONTENTS~
In the summer of 2013 John Lundstram started England’s opening match at the Under-20 World Cup alongside Ross Barkley, Harry Kane and Eric Dier, with John Stones on the bench. Last Sunday, while the other four players contested the Premier League match between Everton and Tottenham Hotspur, Lundstram was pursuing his football education at Oxford United, having turned down a new contract at Everton in the summer. “It was the best decision I ever made,” says the 21-year-old midfielder who aims to show on Sunday, when Oxford host Swansea City in the third round of the FA Cup, that he has what it takes to graduate back to the elite.Lundstram was nominated for the League Two player-of-the-month award for December and feels that his career is finally taking flight. It is doing so partially because he has learned to exert more control over the direction he takes.In 2013 he went to the World Cup on the back of impressive performances as a loanee at Doncaster Rovers, whom he helped to the League One title, and with high hopes of breaking into the Everton first team. But that was also the summer in which Roberto Martínez arrived at Goodison Park to replace David Moyes, under whom Lundstram had seemed poised to make a breakthrough.“When David Moyes was at Everton I was in the squad and with the first team and doing really well but as soon as he left it just wasn’t the same for me,” says Lundstram without bitterness. “It’s a game of opinions and I wasn’t involved in the first team as much as I’d have liked under Martínez. I was meant to go on a pre-season tour with the first team when I came back from Doncaster and then, a couple of days before that, I got taken off the squad list to go and I was never told why. That knocked my confidence a bit and little things like that set me back a bit. Then I had to go on loan to Yeovil.”Michael Appleton and Oxford United well set despite penalty trauma Read moreYeovil were bottom of the Championship and their style did not suit a player whose main quality is his expansive passing. “It wasn’t the right club because we never had the ball,” he says, raising an issue that affects many young players’ development: in three years as a professional at Everton he went to five different clubs on loan and wishes he had been more assertive about his moves. “If I had my time again, I’d have more say in where I went and would say ‘no’ to some things. But I was just trying to please the manager and saying ‘yes, yes, yes’ all the time.”When his contract expired at Goodison last summer Everton offered him a six-month deal but this time he did say no. “I didn’t feel it was worth wasting any more time, so I just wanted to get out there and start playing first-team football regularly – and not on loan for once. It definitely makes a difference being permanent. You just feel much more part of things.”Lundstram is certainly a crucial part of an Oxford team that stands third in League Two. Liam Sercombe and Kemar Roofe tend to score the goals but Lundstram usually conducts the attacking. “I just want to get on the ball as much as I can,” he says.That is a common aim throughout the team, which is why Swansea are fitting opponents: since being taken over by the businessman Darryl Eales in 2014, Oxford have made no secret of their ambition to emulate the Welsh club by ascending from the bottom league to the top while playing a slick, possession-based style. “There are a couple more teams in League Two who also want to play that way but I believe we’re the best at it,” says Lundstram.Promotion is this season’s main aim and, since Oxford do not have an enormous squad, it will be a challenge to continue competing on all fronts. Indeed, they go into the Swansea game with their manager, Michael Appleton, grappling with the difficult issue of whether to rest players for Thursday’s first leg of the Johnstone’s Paint Trophy area final against Millwall – victory in that tie would secure a rare Wembley appearance for Oxford.“It’s well documented how important the promotion push is but all the lads want to get to Wembley as well so the JPT is massive for us,” says Lundstram, who adds that the Swansea match is “a no-pressure game really”. It is, however, a match in which the players yearn to make a statement.“A lot of the lads here are good enough to play at the highest level and I think everyone’s mindset is we’re going to go out and prove how good we all are,” says Lundstram. In a season in which Jamie Vardy and Dele Alli have shown that real talent can be found in the lower leagues, Oxford want to provide further evidence. “With all the money involved in the Premier League it’s tough for a young English lad to come in but there are definitely some gems in the Football League who could play at the top,” says Lundstram. “It’s just about getting the chance.”On Sunday Lundstram and his team-mates have a chance to make their point. Mind you, while watching the draw Lundstram hoped he would be given an opportunity to make it against someone else: “I was clutching the couch hoping for it to be Everton and then I definitely would have had something to prove,” he says with a benign laugh. “But this is a great tie – and, if we get through, I’ll be begging for Everton.”

Scottish roundup: Louis Moult scores as Motherwell thrash Cove Rangers

Nial Briggs
~CONTENTS~
Motherwell eased their way into the fifth round of the Scottish Cup with a 5-0 thrashing of Highland League team Cove Rangers at Fir Park. Striker Louis Moult started the scoring in the first minute with a close-range header and further goals from the striker Scott McDonald, the winger Marvin Johnson and the midfielder Stephen Pearson had the home side 4-0 up by the interval. Pearson scored his second goal just after the hour mark, with a driven shot, but the visitors worked hard to prevent further damage against the Premiership outfit.Despite being without a win in nine Scottish Premiership games, Dundee United managed to avoid a Cup shock by beating Airdrieonians 1-0 with a Blair Spittal free-kick at the Excelsior Stadium.The holders, Inverness, and Stirling Albion contested the only tie that finished goalless and must replay in Inverness a week on Tuesday.A well-executed Craig Slater free‑kick means Kilmarnock reach the last 16 with a 1-0 win, at the expense of a St Johnstone side that have now failed to net in their past four matches.Brad McKay’s second-half equaliser earned Dunfermline a replay after he had given away a penalty in the first half, as the Pars battled out a thrilling 2-2 draw with Ross County at East End Park.The centre-half, who joined on loan from St Johnstone 24 hours earlier, found the net with a header after the break to reedeem himself for conceding the spot-kick which was scored by Brian Graham in the first half. County opened the scoring after three minutes through Alex Schalk but Dunfermline restored parity with a fantastic effort from Faissal El Bakhtaoui. Graham restored the Staggies’ lead in the 27th minute from 12 yards, despite being involved in an off-the-ball incident with Jason Talbot in the build-up to the penalty. However, McKay ensured that this tie will be decided in Dingwall after scoring the equaliser for the home side.Meanwhile, 10-man Linlithgow Rose came from behind to share a 3-3 draw with Forfar.In the ties wholly contested by Championship sides, Dumbarton beat Queen of the South 2-1 and Morton beat rivals Livingston 1-0, courtesy of a Thomas Ware header.Two second-half goals gave Hibs a passage into the fifth round at the expense of Raith Rovers. Darren McGregor opened the scoring after 61 minutes and a long-range shot from Dominique Malonga resulted in a second two minutes later.

Pep Guardiola is putting Manuel Pellegrini in the shade
~~AUTHOR~~
Daniel Taylor
~CONTENTS~
There are still six months or so before Pep Guardiola officially checks into the Premier League but English football already seems so besotted with the departing Bayern Munich manager, his easy sophistication, the Hollywood-handsome looks and knack of elevating football to its highest level, it might not be universally popular to point out he has not done his prospective new employers many favours recently.Manchester City ease past Norwich City as Sergio Agűero shows his class Read morePerhaps it would have been noted more widely had Guardiola not always seemed like the reasonable one when he was in charge at Barcelona and there was so much needle between him and José Mourinho, then at Real Madrid, the two men seemed filled with revulsion that they occasionally had to share one another’s oxygen.Guardiola always represented a style. He did it for the most part with great dignity and the Premier League will be a better place with him. “I forget for whom the description ‘women want to be with him, men want to be him’ was first coined,” Graham Hunter wrote in Barça, the Making of the Greatest Team in the World, “but it fits Guardiola as perfectly as those 30in-waist trousers which still, improbably, fit his snake hips.”It is a shame, however, that Guardiola appears to have abandoned the managerial etiquette that would usually be expected of him or stopped to think, as Arsène Wenger recently suggested, that someone in his position should understand the consequences of announcing mid-season that he is to leave Bayern Munich for a new challenge in the Premier League.Guardiola might not have mentioned Manchester City by name but his subsequent declaration that there had already been “several offers” was, in effect, confirmation that the club built on Abu Dhabi’s riches were actively trying to lever him in at Manuel Pellegrini’s expense. Unless, that is, you want to believe it was Swansea City, who have been trying to persuade Guardiola to repel Chelsea’s advances and ignore whatever is going on with Louis van Gaal at Manchester United.No, it is pretty obvious what is going on and it has certainly put Pellegrini in an awkward position now it is absolutely clear the club’s chief executive, Ferran Soriano, and director of football, Txiki Begiristain, are preparing to ease him out the door. Every one of Pellegrini’s press conferences now has a Guardiola theme. Every flaw will be used as another piece of evidence why Abu Dhabi want an upgrade. The volume will only go up over the coming months and it wouldn’t be the strangest thing if there was a shift, even subconsciously, in how the players view the current manager. Sir Alex Ferguson, reflecting on the 2001-02 season, when he eventually aborted plans to retire, can testify from first‑hand experience that a manager’s voice is not so effective when the players suspect he is not going to be there much longer.What goes around comes around, you might think, given the way Pellegrini was recruited in the first place and how the news broke on the morning of the 2013 FA Cup final, contributing to a 1-0 defeat against Wigan Athletic and the most traumatic day City have experienced since the Abu Dhabi takeover (featuring chants from the losers’ end of “You can stick your Pellegrini up your arse”).   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest  Pep Guardiola: I want to coach in England – videoReal Madrid and Gareth Bale give Zinedine Zidane the perfect start Read moreRoberto Mancini later accused City of speaking to at least three managers while he was in charge, perhaps conveniently forgetting he was tapped up for Mark Hughes’s job several months in advance. On and on it goes. It is a cut-throat industry and City have a long history of awkward handovers if you remember that when Frank Clark was sacked – “The Job from Hell,” he calls the relevant chapter in his autobiography – he heard about it via the breakfast news on Radio GMR. Joe Royle, who had accepted the job the previous night, ended up taking City to court when he was asked to clear out his belongings a few years later. There were people in that old regime, he once told me, with “more faces than Tutankhamun”.That goes back to the era of “Cityitis”, losing to York City, an Auto Windscreens Shield tie against Mansfield Town and one infamous AGM at Bridgewater Hall being interrupted by a supporter allowing all the pent-up frustration to get the better of him and telling the panel of directors he was sick of “20 years of shit”.It’s very different now, of course. There is an expertise at City and scale of ambition that Guardiola must find attractive. Their training ground is the best in England and the size of a village. The stadium has been enlarged and, at every level, there is the sense they know exactly what they are doing. It is a brilliantly slick operation and if City want to be thought of as the best club around it makes perfect sense to go for the best manager.Equally, at the risk of sounding overly cynical, it does feel like the lines are possibly starting to blur when City are now being strongly linked to Leroy Sané, of Schalke, and this is a player Guardiola has already acclaimed as the rising star of German football. “Sané is a huge talent and I can only congratulate Germany to have a talent like him,” Guardiola said in November. A coincidence? Or are things so far down the line that City are now putting in place deals for players to suit their manager-in-waiting?Pellegrini will bank a decent payoff, inevitably, and one imagines he might be a good fit ultimately for the Chile national job at some point, with doubts currently surrounding Jorge Sampaoli’s position. Equally, would it be outlandish to suggest that he might be a reasonable candidate for Chelsea if Roman Abramovich cannot ambush the Guardiola deal? Diego Simeone’s work at Atlético Madrid makes him an outstanding alternative but Pellegrini, despite his deliberately low profile, promotes the attacking football that Abramovich craves and has the advantage of speaking English.For now, all that can really be said for certain is that Guardiola has consistently shown the most beautiful way to win football matches and it is true that City, often doing the bare minimum, look like a team in need of a change in direction.Thierry Henry was asked recently to explain how it worked under Guardiola and recalled how his former manager had a system at the Camp Nou based around the “three Ps” – play, possession and position. “The most important one was position,” Henry explained. “You have to stay in your position, trust your team-mates and allow the ball to come to you.”Guardiola wanted wide players who would not succumb to insecurity if the ball was not coming their way. He even put down cones on the training field so it was drilled into them to stay wide, stretch the play and not cross over. It was the final part of the pitch, close to the penalty area, when they were given the freedom to explode into life and drive infield. “My job is to take you up to the last third,” Guardiola would tell them. “Your job is to finish it.”Yaya Touré’s comments lack class and risk overshadowing his wonderful talent Read moreAs for what happens when a player goes against the Guardiola credo, Henry found out one night in the Champions League. “Me being me, I went there [to the right wing] to play with Leo [Messi]. I didn’t really care, you know. I scored a goal, 1-0 up against Sporting Lisbon, all nice and everything. I could hear him [Guardiola] being upset. And, at half-time, he took me off. I was like: ‘What did I do wrong?’ Very similar to Van Gaal, when Pep had a plan – respect his plan.”Guardiola is, in short, football royalty. His players were so in thrall of him at Barcelona they lined the front rows of the press conference when he announced he was leaving. Guardiola, as Jorge Valdano one said, believes in football where “greatness is possible … He never cheats, he is always brave, he takes away all the miseries of the game.”Nobody could argue City would be better off as they are and Pellegrini, at 62, is streetwise enough to know what is going on. It is just a pity, perhaps, Guardiola has not shown him a little more consideration and it probably says a lot for the current manager that he has not, and will not, make a fuss.Players have eyes on TV deal tooIt didn’t really come as a huge surprise to discover Marko Arnautovic had turned down Stoke City’s opening contract offer, incorporating a pay rise to reflect his position as the club’s leading scorer this season. Stoke’s pay ceiling is £70,000 a week. Arnautovic wants more – in excess of £100,000 – and while that may seem way over the top for a club of Stoke’s size it is merely a reflection of how the Premier League’s new television deal is threatening to shape the sport at that level.The impact of a £5.136bn package means the mid-sized clubs will be so wealthy they can resist bids for their better players. Yet the players and agents know that, too, and will want to be paid more than ever when there will be so much money swilling around from next season.Leicester City may discover something similar when it comes to increasing Jamie Vardy’s £40,000-a-week salary, although they do have an advantage over Stoke bearing in mind he is contracted until 2018. Arnautovic’s deal expires at the end of next season and he is approaching the stage where his transfer value starts to depreciate. Financially, he couldn’t have timed it much better.Ferrell helps LAFC reach mediocrityUntil now, Will Ferrell’s involvement in football has mostly been limited to an appearance in the Soccer Aid match at Old Trafford in 2012, sharing a pitch with the likes of Gordon Ramsay, John Bishop and Robbie Williams. “A lot of jerky people,” Ferrell summarised, ahead of a match most notable for the tall bloke from Kasabian chipping David Seaman.It was a surprise therefore to hear that the star of the Mediocre American Man Trilogy, featuring the Anchorman films and Talladega Nights, is now one of the co-owners of Los Angeles FC, wannabe entrants into MLS for the 2018 season. Indeed, Ferrell seemed pretty surprised himself. “I’ve never been a part-owner of anything,” he said, before correcting himself. “Actually, I’m still part‑owner of an ‘84 Toyota Camry with my brother.”In total, LA now have 26 co-owners, including Magic Johnson, Mia Hamm, the author Tony Robbins, various figures from the baseball world and not forgetting Vincent Tan, Cardiff City’s owner, and Ruben Gnanalingam, joint chairman of QPR, two clubs rightly held up as role models for the way they handle themselves. LA might not have any players yet, or a stadium, but board meetings should be a lot of fun. “I immediately regret this decision,” as Ron Burgundy once said.

Real Madrid and Gareth Bale give Zinedine Zidane the perfect start

Sid Lowe
~CONTENTS~
Gareth Bale took home a souvenir from Zinedine Zidane’s first game as manager of Real Madrid, leaving the Santiago Bernabéu with the match ball signed by his team-mates. Unlike Bale, most of them welcomed the decision to sack Rafa Benítez on Monday but his disappointment did not last long. It certainly did not show on the pitch where the Welshman scored a hat-trick in this victory against Deportivo de La Coruña, departing to a standing ovation with a quarter of an hour to go.Real Madrid 5-0 Deportivo: La Liga – as it happened Read moreHe was not alone; applause was the soundtrack of the night, the whistles of recent weeks gone. Five days can be a long time in football, especially when there is such a hurry to forget the past.On Monday night Zidane’s family occupied seats in the front row of the Bernabéu press room before Benítez’s sacking had even been officially announced; on Saturday night he occupied his place on the edge of the technical area where he saw Karim Benzema’s first goal put his team on course and his second goal round off a perfect debut. Between those two Bale scored three.“Gareth can be very happy about what he did tonight. It is not easy to score three goals,” Zidane said. So what now? “Continue like this.”   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest  Zinedine Zidane: ‘The best thing for me was everyone’s attitude’ – videoAs an exercise in changing the atmosphere, maybe even in political survival, Zidane’s arrival had already proven an instant success; the doubt was whether it would be a lasting one. Or even if it would last beyond the first game. It did. At times, Madrid were impressive here, a dynamism and enthusiasm about their play that had been absent of late. “We played the ball well and created chances,” Zidane said. “We will improve, too. I’ve only just arrived; you have to give us time.”Time is rarely given here, but he will anticipate more of it than his predecessor got. Pushed aside without a word, Benítez barely got a goodbye on Monday. Treated as if he had never even been there, no explanation offered and no time spent lamenting his departure or justifying its arrival only 13 days after the president, Florentino Pérez had insisted: “Zidane will not replace Benítez.” His sacking was, rather, the tiniest prelude to introducing Zidane; there was celebration, not contrition.Here, that continued. Zidane shirts were on sale in the club shop and when his name was announced a huge roar greeted it, followed by applause. The mention of Benítez’s had been whistled weekly since the clásico. Many of the players felt the same way – Bale’s disappointment was not widely shared – and Zidane’s arrival changed the atmosphere. It also left them without an excuse to hide behind.As for Bale, Zidane promised that he would give him the same “affection” that Benítez had. He certainly had freedom of movement, coming inside from the right to great effect: all three goals were scored in a striker’s position, fears of an “exile” on the wing unfounded.Zidane’s first team was a 4-3-3 with Luka Modric, Toni Kroos and Isco in midfield, although the latter – returning after only 12 minutes in the last six league games – was often close to the front three, heading left and leaving Modric and Kroos behind. Up front were Bale, Benzema and Cristiano Ronaldo, as Zidane had promised. At the back, Dani Carvajal replaced Danilo.Madrid led on the quarter-hour when Sergio Ramos’s volley from a corner was flicked in by Benzema. Until then Deportivo had been dangerous, Lucas Pérez just missing a cross from Fede Cartabia, while Madrid momentarily exhibited familiar flaws. The disconnect between the front three and the rest was reduced but Deportivo moved the ball well, encountering time and space. Pérez sliced one over, then took on two shots in a minute.But Madrid were growing and they, and the fans, enjoyed this. At times the football was impressive: quick and offensive. Ronaldo cut inside and shot wide before Bale made it 2-0, heading in Carvajal’s cross.Zinedine Zidane: the No10 overcomes his doubts to step into Real Madrid cauldron | Paul Doyle and Sid Lowe Read moreBale then clipped a lovely ball to Ronaldo which he headed against a post. The applause grew, as much for moments of intensity as inspiration. Modric most warmed their palms.Five minutes into the second half Bale made it 3-0, neatly slotting home Ronaldo’s ball. Then he headed in Kroos’s corner for his 10th goal in seven games and his third of Zidane’s opening night, before Benzema crashed home in the final minute.

Arsenal’s mettle faces test in Premier League’s hectic January schedule
~~AUTHOR~~
Paul Wilson
~CONTENTS~
Just past the halfway stage in the Premier League campaign many of the questions posed by a topsy-turvy first five months remain unanswered. It is still hard to work out, say, whether Louis van Gaal is the solution or the problem at Manchester United. Is this going to be Arsenal’s season at long last or are Manchester City going to get their act together in time to take the title back to the north? Leicester City are not being mentioned as possible champions with quite the same earnest incredulity now they have been knocked off top spot but can they keep up enough momentum to make it into the Champions League? And is Chelsea’s decline terminal or will there be a swift ascent of the table under Guus Hiddink now that John Terry has admitted the team has recovered its memory of how to play?Olivier Giroud puts seal on Arsenal’s Cup win against Sunderland Read moreAll these questions and more, including whether Jürgen Klopp and Sam Allardyce are going to live up to their reputations as saviours at Liverpool and Sunderland, and whether Steve McClaren, Alan Curtis and Rémi Garde are going to have time to make reputations for themselves before the relegation net closes in, should start to be resolved in the next month.There are FA Cup weekends at the beginning and the end of January but three full rounds of Premier League fixtures in between, beginning with some extremely tasty games in the next few days. By the end of the month the overall picture should be much clearer. It is even possible a semblance of normality may have returned.The poor old FA Cup has been rather overshadowed by the round of midweek league games that follows so shortly in its wake. Anyone who imagines this is accidental, and not deliberate policy on the part of the Premier League, has clearly not been paying attention. If there is a space the Premier League can occupy to ensure even higher visibility than before, any greensward of tradition that can be trampled over, Richard Scudamore and his team are ready to pull on their boots.Of course the FA Cup has been devalued but it is not Scudamore’s job to worry about it. No one else does, apart from broadcasters tasked with polishing it up and presenting it to a sceptical public as if it were the sporting equivalent of Aladdin’s lamp.The magic, or at least all the gold and gleaming riches, are in the Premier League now, and it was not difficult to sympathise with Allardyce when he insisted Sunderland’s game at Swansea on Wednesday had to be his priority. A glance at the table shows why. Sunderland are in the bottom three and would stay there even with a victory in Wales. But lose that game and Swansea, one of the two or three sides Allardyce might hope to climb above eventually to survive, would open a seven-point gap and Sunderland would begin to look stranded.For exactly the same reasons Swansea have to be looking at taking three points from opponents beneath them in the table. It would not be an exaggeration to suggest Curtis’s first league game since being confirmed as Swansea’s manager for the rest of the season could hold the key to all that follows.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Steve McClaren should regard Manchester United as beatable when his Newcastle side face them this week. Photograph: Eddie Keogh/ReutersThis week also brings Newcastle against Manchester United, always a tough game whatever the situations of the participants, and this time undoubtedly a pointer to McClaren’s future on Tyneside. Van Gaal’s United have to be regarded as beatable – perhaps not easy to beat, not exactly there for the taking, but nothing to be frightened of either. Newcastle showed their resolve with huge results against Liverpool and Spurs before Christmas, only to falter against Aston Villa and West Bromwich. If McClaren is looking for a statement result to set up the second half of the season, this could be his opportunity. What Van Gaal is looking for is less clear but with an away game at Liverpool to follow next weekend he will be hoping to avoid any more crisis management.Before Liverpool get to play Manchester United they take on Arsenal on Wednesday. Given Klopp’s well-publicised injury problems, the league leaders might feel this is a good time to visit, though assuming Liverpool can raise a team, their record against top sides under their new manager is encouraging.Perhaps wins against José Mourinho’s Chelsea ought to be regarded as devalued currency – something one would not have envisaged saying a few months ago – but the manner in which Liverpool demolished Manchester City in November rightly had people talking of a title challenge.Tottenham are now regarded as the best outside chance, along with Leicester, and the sides with the fewest defeats meet at White Hart Lane on Wednesday in a game that could establish which of the pretenders keeps up the challenge longest.Manchester City ease past Norwich City as Sergio Agűero shows his class Read moreAlso this month Stoke v Arsenal is every neutral’s favourite game and Arsenal v Chelsea can hardly fail to be significant. Arsène Wenger, having broken his duck against Mourinho in the Community Shield, knows he will have to carry round his woeful league record against his arch-antagonist for the rest of his days, though a victory against Hiddink’s Chelsea would go a long way to help compensate.If Arsenal can come through against Liverpool, Stoke and Chelsea, people will have to stop making jokes about their ability to stay on top of the table. They do not have to travel to Manchester City until May so their best plan might be to try to put some distance between the two clubs by then.While this will be their most demanding month, January is not just about top-of-the-table issues. What about Aston Villa v Leicester next weekend, or Swansea v Watford? Villa and Swansea might have had those down as winnable games at the start of the season.Sunderland would definitely have fancied their chances against Bournemouth five months ago, little knowing that the Cherries would embarrass Chelsea and Manchester United before long, not to mention the mid-September 2-0 victory that played its part in Dick Advocaat’s departure a couple of weeks later. Now, 23 January pits Big Sam against Plucky Eddie, pragmatism v romance, world-weariness in one corner, heart-warming optimism in the other. The manager no one thought would go down taking on the one no one thought could stay up.With due respect to the FA Cup’s unofficial new slogan, it is the Premier League where anything can happen.

FA Cup third round roundup: Colchester upset Charlton and Pompey force replay
~~AUTHOR~~
Guardian sport
~CONTENTS~
There were few shocks in the FA Cup third round but one of the surprises came at the Western Homes Community Stadium where the League One strugglers Colchester United overcame Championship Charlton Athletic.George Moncur and Marvin Sordell gave the home side a 2-0 half-time lead and a perfect afternoon was blighted only by Reza Ghoochannejhad’s late consolation for the Addicks.“There’s only one club I want in the next round and that’s West Ham,” said the Colchester manager (and former West Ham player) Kevin Keen. “It would be a dream for me. We were fantastic, we got our rewards and everyone was absolutely top drawer. A few of them proved that they should be playing at a higher level.”The Charlton interim head coach, Karel Fraeye, whose side lie 23rd in the Championship, said: “We put out a team that should be strong enough to beat Colchester and they were not … We are in the situation that we are in now and this battle will not stop.”Colchester were not the only League One side to defeat Championship opposition, with Walsall putting out Brentford and their former manager Dean Smith thanks to Sean Mantom’s first-half goal. Smith saw his former side the Saddlers ease into the fourth round at Griffin Park but vowed to “look at the bigger picture”, having rested four first-choice players due to fixture congestion. “I did want to win the game, especially against my old club … I’ll tell you if I did the right thing after the Burnley game.”And Peterborough United also knocked out Championship opposition in the shape of Preston North End, with another manager – Posh’s Graham Westley – getting one over a former club.Championship Ipswich Town survived a scare against League Two Portsmouth, with Mick McCarthy’s side needing a late equaliser from Ryan Fraser to force a replay after a 2-2 draw at Portman Road. “I thought they were excellent,” said McCarthy. “I was relieved to go in at half-time 0-0 though I did think we were better in the second half. We were below par but they are one of the better League Two teams.”There were four home wins in five all-Championship ties. The 2014 finalists Hull City were 1-0 winners over Brighton & Hove Albion, Steve Evans’ Leeds United triumphed 2-0 over his former club Rotherham United, Burnley surprised the leaders Middlesbrough with a 2-1 win at the Riverside, Sheffield Wednesday won 2-1 against Fulham, and QPR extended their winless run against Nottingham Forest at the City Ground to 31 matches after a 1-0 defeat.Huddersfield Town and Reading face a replay after a controversial stoppage-time penalty allowed Nahki Wells to make it 2-2, and League Two Northampton Town took Championship strugglers MK Dons to a replay, with Ricky Holmes scoring twice in a 2-2 draw. The League One rivals Bury and Bradford City will also have to do battle again after a 0-0 draw at Gigg Lane. Blackburn Rovers’ visit to Newport was postponed.

Paul Scholes: Manchester United players looked bored against Sheffield United
~~AUTHOR~~
Paul Wilson
~CONTENTS~
Paul Scholes led the chorus of criticism over Manchester United’s latest underwhelming display, when they took 70 minutes to register a goal attempt on target against Sheffield United of League One and needed a Wayne Rooney penalty in stoppage time to reach the next round of the FA Cup. Louis van Gaal attempted to suggest that the only thing that mattered was Manchester United’s presence in the draw for the fourth round but Scholes and a number of fans begged to differ.“It’s not good enough in my eyes,” the former midfielder, now working as a pundit for BT Sport, said. “They didn’t create a chance and winning a game against a League One side with a 94th-minute penalty was not a great performance, but we haven’t seen anything different for the last six months.“There are too many square pegs in round holes and you see too much boring, negative football. The players looked bored, there’s no spirit, nobody having a go at each other, no entertainment. I think even Van Gaal on the bench looks bored, but he’ll come out and say he was happy.”The Manchester United manager did not quite do that, though he did try to claim some of the criticism was unfair. “Sheffield United did not create any chances either, but no one talks about that,” he said, showing a fine disregard for the unwritten rules of Cup football against lower league opponents. “They played with 10 men behind the ball and that is the most difficult situation to overcome in football, it is easier to defend than it is to attack.“In a cup game the most important thing is always to win, and at least we did that. We are in the next round and that is all that really matters, but I could not be so happy with the performance. We moved the ball too slowly and we needed to play with wingers to make the pitch as big as possible. Juan Mata is a very good player but he is not a right-winger and that is why I brought him off and put Memphis Depay and Jesse Lingard on.”The substitutions did make a difference – it was Depay who won the last-gasp penalty – but before that his directness and willingness to go for goal had the Old Trafford crowd clapping and cheering with exaggerated enthusiasm to let Van Gaal know he should have been on all along. “As Manchester United manager I have to deal with that, just as the players do,” Van Gaal said. “But I know we have to improve, we have to be quicker and much better.“I don’t think we will be doing any business in January but we need creative players, we don’t have too many. But in the end we are in the next round and we kept a clean sheet.”Wayne Rooney saves Manchester United’s blushes against Sheffield United Read moreArsenal’s mettle faces test in Premier League’s hectic January schedule Read more

Overall, I think we have no new injuries so I’m not worried.

Wayne Rooney saves Manchester United’s blushes against Sheffield United
~~AUTHOR~~
Paul Wilson
~CONTENTS~
Apparently anything can happen in the FA Cup. With due respect to Sheffield United, who played extremely well and deserved a replay, nothing happened here until Memphis Depay won a penalty in stoppage time to allow Wayne Rooney to spare the home side’s blushes. To say the result was an injustice would be to risk the understatement of 2016. Rooney put away the penalty confidently enough after Dean Hammond had fouled Depay, but before the ball was placed on the spot the Premier League side seemed to be having difficulty working out where the goal was.Paul Scholes: Manchester United players looked bored against Sheffield United Read moreEven by Manchester United’s recent standards this was almost comically dull. The 10th successive Old Trafford first half without a goal was followed by another 45 minutes of the same. Being held scoreless by Chelsea or West Ham is one thing but when a League One side can manage it questions need to be asked. The late face-saver cannot hide the fact that Manchester United’s first shot on target took 70 minutes to arrive.Once again Manchester United played far too much sideways football, favouring possession when penetration was called for and consequently barely managing any attempts on goal worthy of the name. When Depay came on as a second-half substitute and was impudent enough to go for a goal almost immediately he was cheered as if he had just supplied the winner at Wembley. Against a lower-division side Depay should probably have been on from the start just for his pace and directness, yet Louis van Gaal preferred a cautious approach and slow build-ups that failed to gain any momentum, and he somehow kept a pedestrian Bastian Schweinsteiger on for the whole 90 minutes.Sheffield United’s brief was clear and well-executed: to stay compact behind the ball and make their opponents work hard for an opening. Manchester United seem to have been working to create an opening for weeks now and Van Gaal admitted beforehand that he hoped the stylish goals against Swansea last week might signal the end of what he called a “terrible” spell at the end of last year.Manchester City ease past Norwich City as Sergio Agűero shows his class Read moreNo such luck. Anthony Martial was back to being peripheral on the left, Rooney struggled to find space in the middle and Juan Mata was involved without being effective. Old Trafford regulars have become accustomed to first-half performances without any goals but this one was almost devoid of chances or excitement. To Sheffield United’s credit it did not look as if one side was two whole divisions lower than the other, though equally the ease with which the visitors kept their hosts at bay reflected poorly on the quality of Manchester United.The only goalmouth incidents of any note before the interval amounted to a couple of through-balls for Rooney to chase – he latched on to one but took it too wide, George Long came out to smother the other – and a decent opportunity for Schweinsteiger from Daley Blind’s diagonal ball. The German fell over, claiming a foul in the area, a decision which was not forthcoming, though he should really have stayed on his feet and done better with a pass that picked him out perfectly in a good position in front of goal.David de Gea had relatively little to do at the other end. He reacted well to save from Conor Sammon, only finding out afterwards that the referee intended to penalise the striker for handball in the build-up. The home side’s attacking efforts in the first half were best summed up by what happened in stoppage time. Mata successfully conned the Sheffield United defence into expecting a cross from a free-kick from a wide position, then rolled the ball backwards for Blind to shoot from the edge of the area. It was a neat training-ground move only spoiled by a shot that almost reached the visiting supporters in the top tier of the East Stand.There was ironic applause from the away end when Mata managed a cross from the right early in the second half. It was comfortable for Long to deal with but it was as if Manchester United had forgotten how to get men wide or make forward runs. Van Gaal tweaked his tactics for the second half to the extent of deploying Marouane Fellaini higher up the field. There should have been ironic cheers at that, really. Sheffield United coped, so Van Gaal’s next wheeze was to send on Jesse Lingard and Depay for the last half hour.Depay actually managed a shot a few minutes after coming on, quite a slick effort that flew only a foot or so outside Long’s right-hand upright. This time there was ironic applause from the Manchester United supporters. The mini-standing ovation in the main stand was going on behind Van Gaal’s back but he will get the idea eventually that a point is being made.In the end “Fergie time” came to the rescue. Easily Manchester United’s most threatening attacker, Depay managed to make the difference during a whopping six minutes of stoppage time, carrying the ball into the box and drawing a wild challenge from Hammond. Tough on Sheffield United, but only the League One club’s accountant could have been looking forward to another 90 minutes of this. The cheers for the winning goal were not ironic, or wild, just sheepish.James Morrison saves West Brom with late equaliser against Bristol City Read more

Sunderland were knocked out of the FA Cup after a 3-1 defeat by Arsenal but Sam Allardyce was more concerned with the immediate demands of the Premier League fixture list. “I’ll be very interested in seeing Swansea’s team tomorrow and seeing how many first-team players they play,” he said.Theo Walcott invites Arsenal fan to join him in on-pitch 'bump' celebration Read moreThe Sunderland manager had put out a relatively strong team at the Emirates despite Sunderland’s trip to south Wales on Wednesday, a game moved back a day to give Swansea time to recover after their Cup tie, at Oxford on Sunday.Allardyce has been irritated by the round of midweek fixtures that means Sunderland travel to Arsenal, Swansea and Spurs in eight days. In its defence the Premier League might point out it has little wriggle room on this particular piece of scheduling given Uefa’s insistence that domestic fixtures are not allowed to clash with its midweek competitions.For now Allardyce clearly intends to apply some pressure to Swansea’s manager, Alan Curtis, to field a strong team in the Cup. “If I was Alan I wouldn’t play my full team. But I’m not Alan. I’m not Jürgen Klopp either,” Allardyce added, unable to resist a dig at the second string fielded at Exeter on Friday by his newest managerial sparring partner.

Rabin Omar’s goals inspire as Annan knockout Hamilton Accies
~CONTENTS~
Annan Athletic pulled off the biggest result in the club’s 74-year history as they beat top-flight Hamilton with a 4-1 victory at Galabank.The League Two club – who only joined the Scottish leagues in 2008 – claimed their first-ever win over Premiership opposition as they moved into the last 16 of the Scottish Cup.Matty Flynn and Josh Todd scored early in each half before Rabin Omar’s double killed off Martin Canning’s team after Greg Docherty had briefly given them hope. Accies travelled south packing just one win in their 13 previous games but the humiliation dished out by Jim Chapman’s men will now raise serious questions about Canning’s future as player-manager.The New Douglas Park side were stunned after just six minutes when Jesús García Tena’s miskick left his side exposed. Omar pounced on the loose ball as he prodded it through for Flynn, who took a touch before beating Michael McGovern. That nightmare start almost got worse seconds later, with only McGovern’s smart reactions keeping out Peter Weatherson’s volley.Hamilton should have been at home on the plastic Galabank pitch but too often they rushed things when a calmer head was needed. They did come close with an Ali Crawford free-kick while Michael Devlin headed over from a corner. But the defender got lucky after his slip-up let Josh Todd race away, with the Annan striker tugging his shot wide.There was no let-off two minutes into the second half, though, as Todd ran on to Weatherson’s pass before stroking a composed finish past McGovern.Hamilton needed a response but Eammon Brophy’s horrible miss on the hour as he pulled a shot wide from six yards out was not it. The young striker did make amends five minutes later, though, as he chested the ball down for the midfielder Docherty to fire home a lifeline.But Hamilton’s hope was snuffed out within 60 seconds as Annan raced upfield from the kick-off, with Omar slotting home at the second attempt from Todd’s cutback.Todd had run the visitors ragged but he somehow failed to net from a yard out when slammed against the post after McGovern spilled Weatherson’s free-kick at his feet. But the home element of the 817 Galabank crowd were in raptures once more as Omar dinked home the fourth after a Ryan Finnie set piece was deflected his way as he put the seal on a famous win.

Bournemouth agree deal to sign striker Benik Afobe from Wolves

Guardian sport
~CONTENTS~
Bournemouth have reached a deal with Wolves to sign striker Benik Afobe for a fee believed to be around £10m, which would be a club record transfer fee.Glenn Murray rescues Bournemouth with late Cup winner at Birmingham City Read moreEddie Howe, Bournemouth’s manager, confirmed the club have finalised an agreement for the 22-year-old, who is due to have a medical this weekend.It is understood Afobe held talks with Bournemouth on Friday and Howe hopes to have him available for Tuesday’s Premier League visit of West Ham.Following Bournemouth’s 2-1 FA Cup win at Birmingham, Howe said: “A deal has been agreed. At this stage there are hurdles to overcome, he will have a medical and we hope to get the deal done in time for Tuesday. He will bring pace, strength, goals and he’s a good technical player as well. He has the whole package. We’re very excited to see him in a Bournemouth shirt.”Glenn Murray scored the winner at St Andrew’s to send them into the fourth round but Howe believes he needed another forward as Callum Wilson is out for the season with a knee injury and Josh King is struggling with hamstring issues.He said: “I felt we needed a striker. Callum we lost and that was a huge blow to us and we have lost Josh King with hamstring problems. It has left us very light and we need firepower. We need players who can come in and do the job.“The players we have here proved they can do a job - Murray came off the bench and scored and it was good to see Lee Tomlin score. But we are light on the ground and hopefully he [Afobe] will add competition for places and real quality in the position.”Wilfried Zaha fires Crystal Palace through making Southampton suffer Read moreWolves confirmed a deal had been agreed, adding: “In the face of significant pressure, Wolves turned down a number of substantial bids for Benik from a Premier League club in the previous transfer window.“Since that point in the summer, until the present day, Benik has regularly restated his desire to leave Wolves and to test himself in the top flight at the earliest opportunity.“Faced with this difficult situation, and with circumstances now changed for Wolves with the club being made available for sale, Wolves were left with little other option than to reluctantly accept the substantial bid. Benik leaves with the club’s best wishes for the future.”

Barcelona back on top of La Liga as Lionel Messi hat-trick sees off Granada
~CONTENTS~
Lionel Messi’s first hat trick of the season helped Barcelona beat Granada 4-0 and take the top spot in the Spanish league on Saturday. Messi scored twice within the first 15 minutes at the Camp Nou, and added his third in the second half as Barcelona cruised to victory. Neymar completed the scoring with seven minutes remaining .The victory lifted Barcelona one point above Atlético Madrid, who play at fifth-place Celta Vigo on Sunday. Barcelona will have a game in hand after the 19th round this weekend. Third-placed Real Madrid trailed Barcelona by five points. Barcelona had drawn four of their last six matches but were coming off a 4-1 win over city rival Espanyol in the first leg of the round of 16 of the Copa del Rey.“I’m very satisfied with how the team played today,” Barcelona’s coach, Luis Enrique, said. “Everybody was focused from the beginning. The players knew how important it was to win these three points.”Barcelona dominated Granada, who were only 17th in the 20-team La Liga table. Messi and Neymar got the goals but Luis Suárez also played well and had chances to score. “We could have scored more,” Barcelona defender Aleix Vidal said. “But the main thing was to get the three points. We are back in the lead, now we’ll see what happens in the other matches.”Messi found the net from close range after a pass from Arda Turan, then bagged his second six minutes later by striking an open net after a pass by Suárez. Messi completed his hat-trick after Neymar struck the post and the ball rebounded to the Argentinian inside the area for his ninth league goal of the season. It was Messi’s 33rd career hat-trick. He has a strong chance of winning a record fifth Ballon d’Or on Monday, from a shortlist which includes Neymar and Cristiano Ronaldo. Neymar sealed Barcelona’s victory from close range, scoring his 15th league goal to tie Suárez as the competition’s leading scorer.Dani Alves, who this week called the Spanish media “garbage” for the way it covers soccer, came off the bench in the second half and was loudly cheered by the Barcelona fans. The club initially condemned Alves’ comments, but late on Friday said it would give its support to the player in case a local association of sports media went ahead with its threat to sue the Brazilian right back.

Wilfried Zaha fires Crystal Palace through making Southampton suffer
~CONTENTS~
Alan Pardew has ruled out signing a defender or midfielder to strengthen Crystal Palace’s chances of succeeding in the FA Cup, reiterating his only transfer target is a striker.The manager watched his team progress into the competition’s fourth round with a 2-1 victory at Southampton, owing to close-range finishes from Joel Ward and Wilfried Zaha either side of Oriol Romeu’s equalising goal, but aware that had they been stronger in the final third they would have won more convincingly.Ward’s 29th-minute goal ended Palace’s run of three games without scoring in which their need for a new striker has been highlighted, but despite reports of interest in Swansea midfielder Jonjo Shelvey and others, Pardew was insistent that only a goalscorer is likely to arrive.“We’ve been linked with a couple of defenders, there will be no defenders coming to this football club,” said the manager, who has made no secret of his intention to prioritise the FA Cup this season.“We’ve been linked with a couple of midfield players, there will be no midfield players coming to this club.“But we are looking for an offensive player, a striker-type player, someone who’s going to contribute to our goal tally, which is an area we’d like to improve a little bit. We’re chasing one or two, and hopefully before the end of January we’ll secure someone.”Asked if his team deserved to win after Southampton twice struck the woodwork in the final minutes and improved during the second half, he responded, “Yes. We’re looking for a home draw. We don’t really care who we get at home, with the fans that we’ve got and the atmosphere we’re going to have in the next round, it’s going to be tough for anybody.“This was a really tough draw for us. Looking at results, we’ve had the best result of the FA Cup, really, to come here and win, so I’m really pleased for the fans who travelled down.”Palace’s opening goal came when Southampton’s Steven Davis conceded possession in midfield, but despite his frustration at the costly error manager, Ronald Koeman, who recalled Sadio Mané to his starting XI, insisted his team’s efforts deserved at least a replay.“We had the better chances,” he said. “In the last 20 minutes we had some good shots on target, good goalkeeping, and we had a header hit the post.“We did everything, but in football sometimes you are not so lucky. We know in the last period we are not as clinical as other teams, but the mistake we made for the first goal makes it difficult to win. You think you’re back in the game at 1-1, but Crystal Palace are a strong team.“We are trying to turn around several things in the club, but we have a good squad. It’s also about belief in the players. It’s difficult at this stage of the season to bring in one player who will change everything. Maybe if we sign Lionel Messi...”

James Morrison saves West Brom with late equaliser against Bristol City
~CONTENTS~
Tony Pulis is prepared for three more weeks of speculation surrounding Saido Berahino after playing down the striker’s FA Cup goal celebration.The 22-year-old’s future has been uncertain since he handed in a transfer request at the start of the season – West Brom rejected several bids by Tottenham – and he began the third-round tie against Bristol City on the bench for the 10th successive game.Berahino was introduced after 63 minutes and took only four minutes to score, curling a low shot off the greasy surface and into the bottom corner. The striker celebrated by running over to the touchline to shake his manager’s hand but Pulis downplayed its significance after the 2-2 draw.“Yes, I owe him some money,” the West Brom manager joked. “He was just grateful for taking a couple of quid off me because he’d scored. I’m pleased for Saido.”Stoke are reported to be the latest club to express an interest in Berahino, who is now cup-tied. Pulis added: “We’ve got two or three weeks of speculation left to keep you journalists happy.”It all looked rosy for West Brom when Berahino struck, but Bristol City turned the tie on its head with goals from Jonathan Kodjia and a substitute, Kieran Agard, who had been on the pitch barely a minute. The Championship club seemed set for a famous victory but James Morrison scored in the fifth minute of injury time to spare the Baggies’ blushes and break City’s hearts.“It’s tough on them but I thought between the two boxes we played some good football and got in some wonderful positions, but our quality in the final third was just lacking,” Pulis said.“We got into some great crossing positions but we couldn’t deliver what we wanted, often hitting the first man. But then we have taken the chances that have dropped to us.“I’m pleased that we kept going and the players are fantastic in that respect, they’re a fit group of lads. But we will certainly have to manage them now in that respect with the number of matches in the coming weeks.” West Brom go to Stamford Bridge on Wednesday to play Chelsea, who are three points below them in the Premier League.Steve Cotterill, the Bristol City manager, was angry with the referee, Graham Scott, after feeling the official played too much added time, allowing Morrison to score. “Four minutes was held up on the board – time was up,” Cotterill said. “It was over.“I know we are splitting hairs here but when you’re 2-1 up away from home against a Premier League team you need the referee to be right on it.“Time was up and he knows it. He probably thinks they’ll get a cross in and a header or something will go over the bar then he can blow after the goal-kick. But you don’t need to add any more. The bottom line is it’s time.” Cotterill could name only six substitutes and had to bring on his replacement goalkeeper, Max O’Leary, at half-time after an injury to Frank Fielding.Cotterill added: “It was a great performance from us but often you don’t get two opportunities against a Premier League team and I felt for our second-half performance we did deserve to win the game.“That would have done wonders for our season in the second half of the Championship, it’s so disappointing. It was important for us.”Pulis had a different view, saying: “He’s got to buy himself a new watch. That’s the best thing he can do.”

Nikica Jelavic scores late for West Ham to defeat Wolves on dismal day
~~AUTHOR~~
Alan Smith
~CONTENTS~
It would have sat uncomfortably with many West Ham fans if this was the last Cup match to be played at Upton Park, but Nikica Jelavic ensured they will be in the draw for the fourth round by scoring the only goal of a largely dismal contest five minutes from the end.Kenny Jackett’s teams have never been easy to break down but for all of Wolves’ impressive resilience and organisation there was equally a shortage of imagination in the home ranks until the introduction of Andy Carroll 20 minutes from time.That substitution led West Ham to revert to a 4-4-2 formation and the pressure eventually told, even if the buildup was a touch clumsy and came about after a soft defensive clearance.Carroll provided the assist. He had tried to shoot from around 25 yards after a poor header away from Ethan Ebanks‑Landell but only met fresh air. However, spotting Jelavic in space to his left, he guided the ball to the Croatian striker, who finished sweetly to the bottom-right corner for his first goal for the club.“It was important” Slaven Bilic said of the substitution. “We were patient, we didn’t lose our shape but changed our system because we needed an extra body in the box. Andy made a big impact.”When Mauro Zárate, best remembered here for comically striking a free-kick straight at a one-man wall, was exchanged for Carroll it said much for the shortage of action that the loudest cheer before the goal arrived was when he was introduced.Until that point West Ham were restricted to attempts from distance, the pick of them coming a minute before the break when Carl Jenkinson’s shot was touched over by Carl Ikeme. The Wolves goalkeeper also made routine saves from Pedro Obiang and Aaron Cresswell.At the other end noteworthy action was even harder to come by. It took 51 minutes for an attempt to be registered, and even that deflected punt from Kevin McDonald was bread and butter for the West Ham goalkeeper, Darren Randolph.Wolves sorely missed the Bournemouth-bound Benik Afobe and their deficiencies in attack were compounded when Bjorn Sigurdarson was carried off after going to ground without contact seven minutes into the second half. Sigurdarson was making his first start since December 2013 and had recently recovered from back surgery. “He collapsed with nobody near him,” Jackett said. “It’s his back again but I have no more information than that.”The visitors enjoyed their best spell soon after that, forcing a succession of corners while Michal Zyro shot straight at Randolph, but the introduction of Dimitri Payet, continuing his return to full fitness after an ankle issue, also galvanised West Ham.He zipped a free-kick narrowly over 10 minutes from the end. Some West Ham supporters, so eager for a goal, started celebrating when the ball hit the wrong side of the net after hitting a stanchion. But they needed to wait only five more minutes.

Manchester City ease past Norwich City as Sergio Agüero shows his class
~~AUTHOR~~
Richard Rae
~CONTENTS~
It may be that Pep Guardiola will replace Manuel Pellegrini as Manchester City manager no matter how many trophies they win this season, but what is certain is that number – and it could still be four – depends hugely on the fitness of striker Sergio Agüero.Making only his 13th start of an injury-hit season, the Argentinian was a class apart, certainly as far as the Norwich City defenders were concerned, scoring a quite brilliant first-half goal (remarkably, his 11th of the season) and setting up another for the promising Kelechi Iheanacho on the half hour.With the result secured, the visitors simply cruised through the rest of the game, taking as little as possible out of themselves against a passive Canaries side, before Kevin De Bruyne, on as a substitute, ensured that the scoreline more accurately reflected the visitors’ dominance.“If you have a winning mentality you want to be involved in every competition until the end,” said Pellegrini, who made seven changes to the side beaten 2-1 at Everton in the first leg of the Capital One Cup semi-final on Wednesday.While there was no Joe Hart or David Silva, and Yaya Touré was left at home nursing an ego cruelly bruised by his failure to win a fifth consecutive African Player of the Year award, Pablo Zabaleta returned to boost City’s creaky back-line, and Agüero started alongside the 19-year-old Iheanacho, whom many City supporters would like to see given an extended opportunity.It was the visitors who had the first shot on target, when Sébastien Bassong’s poor touch gave Agüero the chance to find Iheanacho. The teenager’s power from a narrow angle required the Norwich goalkeeper John Ruddy to palm the ball over the bar.Ruddy also had to dive to push away Aleksandar Kolarov’s low shot and, having gained momentum, the visitors made it count. Agüero’s run was as strong as it was skilful, beating four attempted tacklers in a drive into the penalty area that ended with him poking the ball past Ruddy as the goalkeeper came out to narrow the angle.Agüero almost made it two 10 minutes later, a clever volley testing Ruddy. Such was the visitors’ dominance that Carrow Road was quiet, and with good reason: Agüero’s touch and awareness resulted in him giving Iheanacho enough room to withstand a feeble challenge and side-foot the ball calmly past Ruddy.The teenager’s finish was almost as unflustered as the setup and, given it was his fifth goal in just over 300 minutes of first-team football this season, it was not hard to see why Pellegrini has said he is not in the market for another striker this January.The Norwich manager, Alex Neil, did eventually send on Kyle Lafferty to give Cameron Jerome some support, but Jesús Navas hit the angle of post and bar before De Bruyne thumped the ball under Ruddy from an angle.“We all know how good he is,” said Pellegrini of Agüero. “He’s a player who makes a difference.”

Glenn Murray rescues Bournemouth with late Cup winner at Birmingham City

~CONTENTS~
No 8-0 win this time, but the strides Bournemouth continue to make are perhaps better reflected in the club-record signing they are due to make on Sunday as Eddie Howe confirmed a fee has been agreed to sign Benik Afobe from Wolverhampton Wanderers.Bournemouth thrashed Birmingham City on their last visit here 15 months ago as they cruised to the Championship title and, after recent wins over Chelsea and Manchester United helped lift them four points clear of the relegation zone, retaining their Premier League status is within reach.Glenn Murray, the substitute, scored their winner at St Andrew’s on Saturday, as Howe’s second string came from behind to claim a hard-fought FA Cup victory, but the priority is very much the league rather than the cup.So Bournemouth will not hesitate to part with a figure of at least £10m to bring in the former Arsenal and England Under-21 striker Afobe, who has followed up last season’s 32-goal haul, for MK Dons and Wolves, with another 10 this term.With their main marksman Callum Wilson sidelined for the season with a ruptured cruciate ligament, Bournemouth are giving themselves every chance of survival. Afobe, 23 next month, is due to have a medical on Sunday and could sign in time to face West Ham United on Tuesday. “A deal has been arranged,” Howe said. “He’ll bring pace, strength and goals, hopefully. He’s a good technical player as well, so he’s the whole package and it’ll be good to see him in a Bournemouth shirt if the deal gets done.”With a quality honed through Arsenal’s academy, Afobe could be a crucial addition for Bournemouth, who have also brought in Juan Iturbe on loan from Roma until the end of the season, pending international clearance.Bournemouth needed a penalty at St Andrew’s to equalise three minutes after the Championship side had taken the lead through Michael Morrison. The Birmingham captain headed in from 12 yards out, from David Cotterill’s free-kick, as Gary Rowett’s side made a rather better fist of this contest than the last time Bournemouth had visited St Andrew’s the week before this manager’s arrival.Lee Tomlin equalised from the penalty spot after Jonathan Grounds was adjudged to have bumped Eunan O’Kane to the turf in the penalty area. In almost exactly the same spot, 14 minutes into the second half, Birmingham were also awarded a penalty. Maikel Kieftenbeld appeared to dive under O’Kane’s challenge, but James Vaughan, on loan from Huddersfield Town, blazed his spot-kick over the bar.Jacques Maghoma, the City substitute, and then Andrew Shinnie shot against the same post before Jon Toral shot wide from the third attempt, although he had been given offside.Birmingham paid the ultimate price five minutes before the end. From Steve Cook’s right-wing cross, O’Kane’s header was parried back for Pugh, whose effort was blocked by Adam Legzdins only for Murray to scramble the ball over the line for his fourth Bournemouth goal of the season.

Eastleigh denied Cup glory by Bolton’s Darren Pratley but earn replay
~~AUTHOR~~
Sachin Nakrani
~CONTENTS~
The FA Cup may have lost some of its lustre over the years but this was the type of afternoon that proves there is plenty of life left in this oldest of competitions. All the clichés were there: a non-league side playing against opponents three divisions and 52 places above them on a mud-soaked pitch and in front of a fervent, record crowd. The only thing that was missing was the shock ending but Eastleigh deserve huge credit for coming so close to providing one and can now look forward to a replay at the home of a Championship club and, with it, a place in Monday’s fourth‑round draw.This match really was a throwback and would have found a place alongside the great FA Cup ties had Eastleigh, currently fourth in the National League, been able to hold on to the lead they earned through Dorian Dervite’s own goal shortly after half-time for three minutes longer. Instead Bolton equalised through Darren Pratley’s close-range strike after the hosts had failed to clear Liam Feeney’s right-sided corner.It was a blow for the majority of the 5,025 who filled this most modest of venues but ultimately they could take pride from their team’s gutsy and positive performance throughout and that having been the sole non-league side in the third-round draw – the first time that has been the case since 1969 – they remain involved in the competition.“The players should be very proud of themselves because their performance was outstanding,” said the Eastleigh manager, Chris Todd. “We are disappointed because we probably should have won the game and that says a lot. They are three divisions above us, and at times we’ve been the better side. We played some great football on what was a very tricky surface.”Tricky was one way to describe the pitch. Neil Lennon, the Bolton manager, called it the “one of the worst I’ve ever seen” and while that could be deemed sour grapes on the part of a man who came almighty close to seeing his team on the receiving end of a cup upset, his criticisms were not utterly outlandish.It took three pitch inspections for the referee, Iain Williamson, to decide conditions were satisfactory enough for the match to proceed in the first place, and even after the go-ahead was given large patches of mud were noticeable across the playing surface with a particularly large patch of sand visible in front of the Mackoy Community Stand – where a section of the 1,100 away supporters were located – covering a damp patch of turf. An hour before play started, staff could be seen still drying the areas by both goals with a leaf blower.That the pitch was even in this state was a credit to staff at Eastleigh and local volunteers who had spent the past few days mopping water away following a deluge of rain in Hampshire in recent weeks. They were at it again on Saturday morning before the biggest match in the club’s 70-year history.As Todd intimated, it was his team who coped best with the conditions – which only worsened following a fresh burst of rain shortly after play had begun – and particularly during the first half when they dominated possession, territory and chances on goal. Yemi Odubade arguably had the best of the lot, a shot from inside the area on 28 minutes that went just wide of the far post and given he was causing Bolton problems with his direct and fast running from wide on the right it was a blow for Eastleigh that he had to go off with a hamstring injury seven minutes later that is likely to keep him out of the replay at the Macron Stadium.The hosts got a reward for their confident, front-foot display on 51 minutes when Dervite turned in Jai Reason’s right-sided cross and it only added to the sense of occasion that it was the midfielder’s 26th birthday.Had the pitch not held up Andy Drury’s 66th-minute shot long enough for David Wheater to clear the danger from the Bolton goalline, the hosts would have extended their lead. Instead it was Bolton who scored following a period of late, sustained pressure and, with it, earn some respite in what has been a nightmare season for the club. The four-times winners of this competition sit bottom of the Championship, having won twice all season, are £185m in debt, have been served a winding-up order by HMRC and face the very real threat of going into administration. Lennon confirmed that Zak Clough and Mark Davies are likely to leave the club during the current transfer window in order to help service debts.The outlook is very different for Eastleigh. A club who were playing in the Wessex League as recently as 2002 and have won one trophy in their history – the Hampshire Cup – are in with a chance of being promoted into the Football League next season and are still in the FA Cup. This has largely been fuelled by ambition and money but also proves that a competition that has taken a kicking is alive and kicking.

Watford’s Troy Deeney pounces to put wasteful Newcastle out of FA Cup
~~AUTHOR~~
James Riach
~CONTENTS~
Newcastle’s abject record in this competition under Mike Ashley continues, but more concerning for Steve McClaren will have been his side’s ineptitude in front of goal. Watford were second best but it is they who advance to the fourth round, Troy Deeney the difference on an afternoon of severe frustration for Newcastle.Since Ashley took control of the club they have not progressed past the fourth round of the Cup in nine seasons. McClaren’s appetite to end that dreadfulrecord was clear, but the afternoon ended with discontent among the travelling supporters who had watched their side lose 1-0 for a fourth successive match.They had played reasonably well, but were gripped by paralysis whenever a sniff at goal emerged. Florian Thauvin was the subject of the fans’ ire late on, some decided to leave before injury time and jeers rang out at the final whistle. Watford were disjointed, but Deeney took his chance while Newcastle squandered theirs.“Very frustrating,” said McClaren, who described the booing as harsh. “One opportunity they had from our mistake and we felt we controlled the game. That’s football. You have to stick the ball in the back of the net. We came here to win, we came here with a strong team. We couldn’t do more than we did, apart from put the ball in the net.“Everybody is frustrated and angry, I can understand that. Everybody can see the team is not far away from doing something.”McClaren made one change to the team that lost narrowly at Arsenal, Kevin Mbabu coming in for the injured Jack Colback. Quique Sánchez Flores had given a first start to the 20-year-old striker Obbi Oularé, but with Odion Ighalo on the bench they struggled to find cohesion. Newcastle, in contrast, were moving well and threatening regularly.Georginio Wijnaldum almost squeezed the ball in at the near post with an improvised flick but Heurelho Gomes had read the danger, the goalkeeper often called upon during the first half. However, there would have been nothing he could have done had Ayoze Pérez hit the target after 27 minutes, Moussa Sissoko driving into the penalty area down the right and pulling the ball back with pace to the Spaniard, who could only sidefoot wide from an excellent position.Mbabu forced Gomes into a smart save with a powerful drive, before Deeney’s sucker punch. Out of nothing, the striker suddenly found himself through on goal following miscommunication in the defence and a dreadful pass from Wijnaldum. Time seemed to stand still for a few seconds, but Deeney demonstrated fine composure to round Elliot andscore.“For us it was the perfect scenario,” said Flores. “Newcastle has an amazing team, in the first half they probably had the control of the match.”Oulare was taken off by Flores at half-time, Ikechi Anya coming on, while Fabricio Coloccini did not emerge for the second half as a precaution, replaced by Jamaal Lascelles. McClaren’s decision to then replace Mbabu with Thauvin was booed.Newcastle have scored 19 times in the Premier League this season and despite producing some decent football frustration was beginning to build. Their lack of confidence in front of goal was evident in the 71st minute when Sissoko broke free and cut inside, only to panic and shank his shot.They did not threaten again and when Thauvin limped to the sidelines in the closing minutes the noise from the away end said it all.

Kevin Mirallas and Arouna Koné ease Everton past Dagenham & Redbridge
~~AUTHOR~~
Andy Hunter
~CONTENTS~
A black and white cat encroached into Joel Robles’s penalty area but the Everton goalkeeper was otherwise undisturbed as Roberto Martínez’s side eased past Dagenham and Redbridge. “He had great style and movement and it will be a great sign if we can keep him for every game,” said the Everton manager. Of the pitch invader.Sport picture of the day: the Goodison cat Read morePost-match focus on a feline reflected the lack of incident elsewhere. The League Two team were by no means disgraced at Goodison Park but never once threatened Robles, nevermind an upset, as Everton recorded the most routine of wins through Arouna Koné’s first goal in 10 games and a late Kevin Mirallas penalty.The visitors have endured a trying season, appointing John Still for the third time as manager on New Year’s Eve having fallen to 22nd and starting this third round tie with two players who had never trained with the squad having arrived on loan on Friday, Joe Worrall from Nottingham Forest and Charlton Athletic’s Oliver Muldoon.Their manager and their performance made no pretence that the ambition was a place in round four. “We needed to make sure we stayed in the match against this type of opposition so from that point of view I am absolutely delighted,” said Still. “We had a gameplan, we couldn’t be too ambitious and we contained them. Not completely, admittedly, but they scored from a free-kick and a penalty. We did as well as we could hope without winning the game.”Dagenham and Redbridge struggled to get a touch in the first half as Everton dominated possession without seriously troubling Mark Cousins in goal until Koné rose above Christian Doidge to head home Bryan Oviedo’s inviting free-kick.Glenn Murray rescues Bournemouth with late Cup winner at Birmingham City Read moreCousins had saved comfortably from Mirallas and impressively from Ramiro Funes Mori before the breakthrough. The Argentina defender required 10 stitches in a head wound that forced him off and leaves him doubtful for Wednesday’s Premier League trip to Manchester City, but a makeshift Everton rearguard featuring home debutant Matthew Pennington alongside the fit-again Phil Jagielka was never tested.Still’s side enjoyed more touches on the ball in the second half but no opportunities to reward the 1,883 travelling supporters, complete with a “North Korea Daggers” banner. Mirallas ensured there would be no late scares for Everton when he was felled inside the area by former Sunderland defender Nyron Nosworthy and picked himself up to convert a clear penalty.Martínez confirmed Aiden McGeady was omitted as Everton have received loan offers from three clubs for the Republic of Ireland international. Celtic are understood to be one. Steven Naismith was absent due to an ankle problem, not because of interest from Norwich City.“The FA Cup never brings easy ties,” Martínez said. But it can bring straightforward victories.

Derby’s Darren Bent destroys Hartlepool dream with late winner
~~AUTHOR~~
Louise Taylor
~CONTENTS~
Darkness had long since descended on Hartlepool and all the talk was of an unwanted replay when Darren Bent reminded everyone of what he used to do best. He may be a bit of a forgotten man at Derby County these days but Bent showed off unerring instincts as he swivelled before expertly volleying Abdoul Camara’s deflected cross beyond Trevor Carson to earn his side a fourth-round place.That late, left-footed winner represented harsh luck on an impressive Hartlepool who, in Michael Woods and Lewis Hawkins, possessed two of the afternoon’s best individuals.Two clubs once managed by Brian Clough kicked off with contrasting priorities. While Hartlepool are simply striving to stay in League Two, Derby’s desperation to win promotion to the Premier League meant Paul Clement made 10 changes from the side that lost at Middlesbrough last weekend.The depth of the visiting squad was emphasised by Clement’s heavily rotated line-up including Bent, an England striker not so long ago. Great things were expected of Woods during his days as a youngster at Chelsea but the midfielder is now settled in Ronnie Moore’s midfield from where he swiftly began directing operations.With Woods and Hawkins constantly stretching them, Clement’s Championship second-stringers laboured until the end the first half when Nick Blackman, making his Derby debut, very nearly scored three times.After the break Camara’s 25-yard half-volley hit the bar before a Hartlepool counterattack concluded with Jake Gray volleying Woods’s cross beyond a helpless Jonathan Mitchell in quite fabulous fashion.Clement replaced Craig Bryson with Jacob Butterfield and promptly watched the substitute lash a long-range equaliser past Carson with his first touch.The scene was set for Bent to register the 200th goal of his club career.

Stoke class tells at Doncaster thanks to Jonathan Walters’ Cup special
~~AUTHOR~~
Richard Gibson
~CONTENTS~
In the end it was the quality of the finishing that meant Stoke progressed beyond this round for the seventh year in a row without the need for a replay. While that of Mark Hughes’s team bore the hallmarks of international class, the late chances fluffed by Doncaster would have made an FA Cup bloopers tape.Jonathan Walters thrashed in what turned out to be a stunning winner as Stoke put the midweek disappointment of conceding a deficit to Liverpool in the Capital One Cup semi-final behind them. Without their twinkle-toed trio of Bojan Krkic, Xherdan Shaqiri and Marko Arnautovic, the honours fell to the Republic of Ireland international and Peter Crouch to navigate the way to victory at the Keepmoat Stadium.Having fielded the same XI in the four previous matches since Christmas, including the single-goal loss to Liverpool, Hughes made nine changes. For continuity’s sake, he retained the central defensive duo Ryan Shawcross and Philipp Wollscheid. They were both kept under the cosh as Doncaster made a mockery of the 45 places in the English pyramid separating the teams at kick-off.It would have been far from an injustice had either Nathan Tyson or Andy Butler converted chances from inside the six-yard box after the clock struck 90 minutes. But, having hauled themselves back to cancel out Crouch’s opener on the quarter-hour, neither could keep the ball down under pressure.“It was a proper cup tie and I don’t think many people left before the end. It went to the wire and we had two great chances at the end,” said Darren Ferguson, Hughes’s former Manchester United team-mate.In contrast to Hughes’s sweeping changes, the single alteration Ferguson made was enforced after their captain, James Coppinger, turned his ankle in training. The other 10 from the 3-0 win at Southend last week, the Yorkshire club’s eighth in a dozen matches, were retained.Doncaster’s equaliser, after Crouch crowned only his fourth start of a frustrating season with a deft finish to Joselu’s centre, had the Yorkshire club’s 13,299 crowd – comfortably the biggest here this season – dreaming of another Ferguson cup tale. The defender Luke McCullough burst half the length of the field before squaring and although Stoke’s debutant goalkeeper Jakob Haugaard parried his initial effort, Tyson was quickest to the rebound.At that point it appeared to be turning into an uncomfortable afternoon for Hughes, who scored in the 1990 Cup final to provide Ferguson’s famous father with his first English trophy. Ten minutes after the restart Conor Grant zipped a drive through a crowded penalty area and narrowly wide and Craig Alcock went down under a challenge from Mame Biram Diouf, only for the referee, Keith Stroud, to wave away home penalty appeals.Doncaster sensed blood only to be bloodied by Stoke’s spectacular counterpunch. A matter of seconds after Crouch got in an almighty tangle to poke over an unguarded net, after Mame Biram Diouf’s header was pushed out by Thorsten Stuckmann, Walters saved his blushes by unleashing his 30-yard howitzer. “It was a good Cup tie, they played well and caused us problems. It’s taken two good quality goals to take the tie away from them,” said Hughes.Even then, Andy Williams, the much-travelled lower-league striker, hit the crossbar with the deftest of headers before the two fluffed efforts in injury time saw Stoke into round four.

Olivier Giroud puts seal on Arsenal’s Cup win against Sunderland
~~AUTHOR~~
Barney Ronay
~CONTENTS~
The winners of this competition for the past two years are through to the fourth round of the FA Cup after a low pressure, ultimately quite comfortable 3-1 defeat of Sunderland at the Emirates Stadium. A slightly weakened Arsenal team took their moments to strike, sealing the tie with second-half goals from Aaron Ramsey and Olivier Giroud, both created by the excellent Héctor Bellerín. Alex Iwobi made a promising first start in the competition, earning praise from his manager for the timing of his passes and his willingness, aged 19, to run with the ball. For now Arsenal’s attempt to become the first team since Blackburn Rovers 130 years ago to win the Cup three times in a row remains on course.Theo Walcott invites Arsenal fan to join him in on-pitch 'bump' celebration Read moreBeyond that it was a result that probably suited both teams. Sunderland took the lead and played with energy throughout. After the game, however, Sam Allardyce continued to rail against the round of Premier League fixtures in midweek that leaves Sunderland with a run of three away trips in the space of seven days. Here Allardyce’s starting XI had seven changes, including 21-year-old Jordan Pickford who made a fine club debut in goal. But it was still a relatively strong team, with Jermain Defoe and Yann M’Vila the most obvious absentees.For his part Arsène Wenger had spoken about the need to respect the competition, the lure of its enduring magic and so on. There is an agreeable oddity in a manager once seen as the vanguard of annihilating overseas modernism emerging as a guardian of English football’s grandest, most faded and outflanked competition. But then, Wenger has been around a terribly long time, a manager who was out there winning semi-final replays when the Cup was still the Cup.He put out a strong team here, the only real concession to the occasion a second start for Iwobi, a long-term academy player but a genuine talent and a full Nigeria international. Iwobi made a bright start, too, playing to the left of central midfield in a 4-1-4-1, with Callum Chambers hoovering up behind and Giroud the lone striker. It was from the left side that Kieran Gibbs had the first real sight of goal, cutting in and shooting at a good height for Pickford to palm the ball over.With 17 minutes gone Gibbs was also involved in Sunderland’s opening goal, losing the ball under pressure from Jeremain Lens just outside his own area. Behind him Laurent Koscielny, surprised by the break of the ball, also lost it, also to Lens, who shot past Petr Cech. It was a poor goal to concede but reward, also, for Lens’s energy and opportunism.Arsenal were level six minutes later. It was a lovely goal, too. Iwobi drove through the inside-left channel, played a nice nudged pass to Theo Walcott, who feinted for the byline then played a beautiful cutback for Joel Campbell to finish with great assurance.After which Arsenal settled into some room-temperature possession, with Iwobi, Walcott, Campbell and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain linking well enough, while Lens did his best to lead Sunderland on the counterattack.The same pattern resumed after half-time as Arsenal pressed a little harder, with Iwobi again giving the impression this was a match that perhaps meant a little more to him than some others on the pitch.Sam Allardyce needles Swansea’s Alan Curtis over strength of Cup team Read moreWith the prospect of a reply beginning to lurk dimly the game sprung to life. Oxlade-Chamberlain hit the post after making space with a jink on the edge of the box. Pickford made an excellent close-range save from Campbell, and in between times Steven Fletcher hit the bar with a header from close range when he really should have scored.With 25 minutes to go Mikel Arteta and Aaron Ramsey came on and Arsenal began to press down the flanks, Giroud and Walcott twice failing to make good contact with low fizzed crosses from the left.It was from the right that the second goal came. Bellerín frolicked in behind Patrick van Aanholt and produced the perfect cutback for Ramsey to angle the ball delicately from close range past Pickford. With 14 minutes to go the same route to goal sealed the game, Bellerín again cutting in with great poise and finding Giroud in the middle to sidefoot the ball home.

Wycombe fight back against Aston Villa with Joe Jacobson spot-on
~~AUTHOR~~
Daniel Taylor
~CONTENTS~
Rémi Garde’s winless sequence as Aston Villa manager now stretches to 10 matches and the indignities continue to stack up for the team holding the Premier League’s wooden spoon. Their supporters began this match by singing about relegation but, by the end, the dark humour had made way for open dissent and the clear sense they are bordering on mutiny.FA Cup third round, Barcelona v Granada and more: clockwatch – live! Read moreGarde’s decision to substitute Carles Gil, Villa’s most dangerous attacker, certainly did not go down well with the supporters who had earlier chanted: “We scored a goal,” in mock surprise at taking the lead against a League Two side that had lost their previous home match to Morecambe. Villa’s main problem is they have scored twice in one game only once since September. Joe Jacobson’s penalty four minutes into the second half means a replay at Villa Park and the away supporters behind Garde’s dugout were so voluble with their criticisms that Micah Richards, having been substituted, left his seat to try to answer their complaints.Those were tense moments, with the game still going on, and at least Villa’s captain was willing to face an angry crowd. Richards was clearly piqued by the accusation that the players were not putting in enough effort and it needed the intervention of a couple of stewards. At the final whistle, there were chants of “You’re not fit to wear the shirt”. Garde was targeted with cries of “You don’t know what you’re doing” and his brief spell in English football has already taken on the form of a full-blown crisis.“I can understand the fans being angry with the results,” he said. “We have to accept the criticism because we are not winning enough games. This is what we deserve. When you are not winning, the manager is always making bad decisions.“I still believe I can turn it around. The day I can’t do anything positive for this big club, you will know about it. I do know what I’m doing – but sometimes it is not working.”It certainly did not work here and there is already talk of a protest at the replay when, once again, it might not be easy getting past the team 54 places below them in the football ladder. “Our away record is even better than our home record,” Gareth Ainsworth, the jubilant Wycombe manager, pointed out. It was an exaggeration but Wycombe did reach the third round by winning ties at Halifax and Millwall and should not be too fazed by a trip to the Midlands. As Martin O’Neill, the former manager of both these sides, pointed out from the television gantry, Villa’s confidence is not so much low as subterranean right now.The worst team in the Premier League, with two wins all season, certainly ought to have made it a more straightforward afternoon after the moment, midway through the first half, when Richards surged forward from right-back to sweep in Gil’s pass for the opening goal. Instead, the match exposed Villa for what they are: a side low on self-belief, conceding all sorts of goals and so devoid of attacking threat there were only sporadic moments when they put their opponents under sustained pressure.Richards was injured in the first half but lasted until the 84th minute. He was their best player but, beyond their captain, there was a startling lack of leadership from Garde’s men. Scott Sinclair, in particular, was a substitution waiting to happen.Rudy Gestede did strike the angle of crossbar and post with a deflected shot late on and Villa might have been spared an awkward second half if the referee, Michael Oliver, had seen Anthony Stewart pulling back Richards in a congested penalty area. Richards’s driving runs forward, having been moved across from his usual centre-back place, were a prominent feature in some of Villa’s better moments.Wycombe Wanderers v Aston Villa: FA Cup third round - as it happened Read moreGil also showed some decent touches but Wycombe, playing with great togetherness, matched their opponents for long spells. Jacobson’s set-piece deliveries were always a threat and Sam Wood had three reasonable chances to score. Ainsworth also deserves credit for recognising that Villa had a spare midfielder in the first half and instructing his forwards to drop back on Ashley Westwood. After that tactical tweak, Villa never played with the same freedom, not least because the Wycombe centre-backs, Aaron Pierre and Anthony Stewart, were outstanding.Before the game, Villa’s fans could be heard singing “sign them up” when a line of flag-waving mascots walked in front of their end. The mood changed for the worse after Westwood’s reckless challenge on Matt Bloomfield gave away the penalty, clattering him with a forearm as they jumped for the same ball. Paul Hayes, Wycombe’s usual penalty-taker, was injured but Jacobson confidently struck the ball past the goalkeeper, Mark Bunn.“To see players running through brick walls for you is such a great feeling,” Ainsworth said. “Pride is the word. Every time I ask my players to do something they never say: ‘I can’t do that.’ They always say: ‘I’ll give it my best shot.’”How Garde must wish he could say the same.Wycombe Wanderers v Aston Villa: FA Cup third round - live!

Yaya Touré’s comments lack class and risk overshadowing his wonderful talent
~~AUTHOR~~
Gary Al-Smith
~CONTENTS~
This week, the very best of African football had gathered in Abuja, Nigeria, for an awards ceremony in honour of the players and teams who had excelled in 2015. It was meant to be a celebration of the continent’s achievements but in the end it was overshadowed by the comments of a man who finished second in the African player of the year awards.It is a shame that the focus has shifted from the winner in that category, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, to a sore loser but perhaps the world should have expected what was to come long before Thursday’s ceremony ended because Yaya Touré was visibly stunned right from the moment it was clear that he was not going to win the top honour for a fifth consecutive year.Yaya Touré’s agent warns Manchester City that Pep Guardiola is over-rated Read moreWhen the Platinum Award (an accolade usually given to the head of state of the country in which the year’s African Footballer of the Year awards is held) had been given to Nigeria’s president, Muhammadu Buhari, there was just one more prize to give out.The three nominees for the final, blue riband award were called on to the stage and then the co-host Juliet Ibrahim started to speak. “And now, the award for the 2015 African Footballer of the Year. In second place,” she began, repeating “second place” for emphasis – no doubt to be very clear and also, perhaps, as a self-check to avoid a Steve Harvey moment “… is … Yaya Touré!”First there is the briefest of pauses from the crowd inside the International Conference Center – the exact time they need to allow the Ivorian’s name to leave Juliet’s lips, travel through her microphone, jump off the walls, slip into their ears and lodge itself into their brains.Then, a collective gasp. Part of the crowd is silent, absolutely stunned. A few guests high-five. Loud cheers come from others. On the live TV feed, viewers are given a close-up shot of a woman mouthing ‘wow, wow, wow’.The real wow, however, is Touré’s reaction in those three seconds. His head, staring down at the floor shortly before his name was mentioned, snaps up. A brief frown and a tightening of the jaw.Looking at him then, we should have known that the Ivorian was not going to take this decision lightly.Perhaps Touré’s bodyguard already knew. He picks up one of the dessert forks on the table and, with eyes trained on his boss on stage, begins rhythmically tapping the fork against a plate. Clink, clink, clink. He watches Yaya closely. We all do.When Aubameyang is announced as the winner, the contrast in facial expressions is stark: Touré sports a stony expression while the Gabonese is unable to stop himself from breaking out in a huge smile.Just before leaving the stage, Touré briefly shakes hands with Ghana’s André Ayew, who finishes in third place, and whispers a word of congratulations to Aubameyang.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Aubameyang polled 143 voting points to Touré’s 136 among national coaches. The 26-year old says he is confident he can retain the title if he keeps playing his best.The official ceremony, what the world sees on television, ends at 10.04pm GMT. Almost immediately after that Touré gets up and walks out of the hall. He asks an official where the post-event press conference is to be done, and heads there.There are no people in the room when Touré and his bodyguard enter, just a few chairs, a dais, and the humming air conditioners. One minute. Two minutes. Three. The four-time African Footballer of the Year starts pacing.“Où sont-ils?”, he says with minor irritation. “Where is everyone?”Just then, three Ghanaian reporters walk in. They hesitate, unsure of his mood and whether to try for an exclusive. Eventually, Nana Akua Amankwaa from TV3 Ghana goes forward.“Hi Yaya, can I get a selfie?”Still pacing, the player responds: “Yes, sure.” After the selfie, she asks for an interview. Touré agrees.While her cameraman gets ready, the third journalist, Kwame Dwomoh from Class FM in Accra, whips out his recorder. Lights are checked. Sound is checked. And then Kwame asks the midfielder: “Were you surprised you came in second today?”“To be honest? Yeah, a little bit. But at the end of the day what you have to know is that in sport anything [can] happen. And to be a player who wants to achieve a lot of things as much as possible, it is very important to keep it going. And sometimes, when, in the end, you win a trophy and you are not able to achieve things personally it is a shame. But what can we do?”Kwame: “Were you expecting to win?”Touré: “What do you think? I ask you a question.”Kwame: “I don’t know”.Touré: “You don’t know? Me as well, I don’t know. Because normally when you win the African Cup of Nations and you are able to be named as one of the 23 best players in the world, being in the Fifpro list as the [only] African and, today, to be decided second, what can you do?”Touré is asked how disappointed he is, considering that this would have been a record fifth award. He blows out his cheeks. “I think so, yeah. Because normally this kind of trophy you achieve it when you have won something and when, at the end of the season, you have achieved something, you know what I mean? I don’t say like I would be the best and I don’t want to complain but when you win important trophies and you don’t win personal trophies it is a little bit of a shame.”Kwame: “Do you want to congratulate Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang?”Yaya: “Yes, definitely. But I think it’s not his fault. The fault is with people he knows, you know what I mean? Aubameyang has been doing brilliantly. As well as André Ayew he deserves it today as well but to be honest with you I am little bit disappointed, but what can we do?”After this interview, the Manchester City player went on to grant similar sentiments to Afrique Foot. The standout comment from there was: “Us Africans, we don’t show that Africa is important in our eyes. We favour more what’s abroad than our own continent. That is pathetic.”Touré is wrong. The only thing that is pathetic here is his lack of class. After winning the award four straight times, he should know better than anyone else that his previous wins have come largely from his European performances. The Ivorian’s first win in 2011 came after a good year with City, when he scored the winner in their FA Cup semi-final victory over Manchester United and in the final against Stoke, ending the club’s 35-year wait for a major trophy. That year, he beat Seydou Keita and André Ayew.A year later, his key role for his club in England on their way to a first Premier league trophy in 50 years meant that he saw off competition from Didier Drogba (who had led Chelsea to the Champions League and FA Cup in 2012) and Alex Song. Touré should not forget that his Ivory Coast side did not win the African Cup that year, but he was still given the award.His third crown in 2013 came the year Mikel John Obi won the Europa League with Chelsea and was also the standout player in Nigeria’s African Cup-winning side. But the imposing midfielder won, beating Drogba as well.In 2014 Touré become the first player to win the accolade four years in succession, and he did it at a time when Nigeria’s goalkeeper Vincent Enyeama had powered the Super Eagles to the second round of the World Cup and had been the best player for Lille in Ligue 1. Touré had been nominated after playing a pivotal role in winning the Premier League and League Cup as well as helping his country to qualify for the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations.History is an even better guide. The top African award has always been biased toward European performances; otherwise the excellent Mohamed Aboutrika should have bagged at least one when Egypt won back-to-back-to-back continental titles between 2006 and 2010. Instead, that period saw Drogba (2006 and 2009), Frederic Kanouté (2007), Emmanuel Adebayor (2008) and Samuel Eto’o (2010) win, mainly on the back of European showings.Touré, though, has a point (even though the timing of the comments have made him look like a very bad loser). Voters must simply be encouraged to lend more weight to African competitions, especially in years when there is an African Cup of Nations. Consistency over 12 months is key, but how does a continent win respect for its flagship events when the top awards go to those who shine outside of Africa?This does not excuse Touré’s churlishness on the night though. But maybe we should not be surprised. The birthday cake incident at City in May 2014 now, with hindsight, almost seems like standard fare.Yaya Touré: awarding African Player of Year to Aubameyang is pathetic Read moreAfter all, this is the man, also in 2014, who claimed he had been overlooked as a contender for the Ballon d’Or simply because of the colour of his skin, which was uncalled for and, quite frankly, nonsense.And then after helping his country win the African Cup last year, he bizarrely lashed out at his countrymen for giving Drogba a bigger welcome to the former Chelsea man for winning silver medals from previous editions.As graceful as he may be on the field, the 32-year old is in danger of being remembered more for his classless comments than his outstanding talent when he retires. And that would be a real shame.African team of the yearRobert Kidiaba (DR Congo/ TP Mazembe), Serge Aurier (Ivory Coast/Paris St-Germain), Aymen Abdennour (Tunisia/Valencia), Mohamed Meftah (Algeria/USM Alger), André Ayew (Ghana/Swansea), Sadio Mané (Senegal/Southampton), Yaya Touré (Ivory Coast/Manchester City), Yacine Brahimi (Algeria/Porto), Mbwana Samatta (Tanzania/ TP Mazembe), Pierre-Emerick Aubameyeng (Gabon/Borussia Dortmund), Baghdad Bounedjah (Algeria/ Étoile du Sahel)

Beating Chelsea is the FA Cup dream for Scunthorpe’s Scott Laird
~~AUTHOR~~
Louise Taylor
~CONTENTS~
Scott Laird has such a sunny personality it is difficult to imagine him in angry mode but even Scunthorpe United’s resolutely upbeat left-back becomes a little cross when football’s chattering classes sneer at the FA Cup. “If you could have seen me jumping around my living room when the draw happened you would have known the magic of the Cup’s still there,” says Laird, who could well find himself marking Willian when Mark Robins’s side face Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Sunday afternoon. “Anyone who says it’s losing its magic is mad.”The 27-year-old speaks with some authority. From participating in the competition’s earliest qualifying rounds as a non-league novice, to helping Stevenage subject Newcastle to a third-round giantkilling in 2011 and scoring for Preston North End against Manchester United in a fifth-round defeat last year, Laird has clocked up some fairly extensive FA Cup experience.FA Cup roundup: Scunthorpe United earn trip to Chelsea but Salford City exit Read more“For me to be able to say to my grandkids that I’ve scored against Manchester United is amazing,” says the one-time Tiverton Town full-back. “What makes this competition so special is that it really is David v Goliath. You get to see non-league players who work nine-to-five pitting their wits against Premier League regulars.“For lower-league and non-league players to test themselves, and their skills, against the best in the world is fantastic. It gives people chances to really show what they can do, get themselves noticed and maybe earn a chance to play in a higher division. The FA Cup can change lives.“There’s no escaping the fact that there’s a big gap between the Premier League and the lower leagues but I do think it’s getting smaller. The standard down here is definitely rising. There are lots of Jamie Vardys in the lower leagues who, given a bit of luck, could make it at the top level – catching the eye of a bigger club while playing in the FA Cup could get them there.”Similarly, knocking Chelsea out would do wonders for local morale in this corner of north Lincolnshire. In October Tata Steel, the principal local employer, placed 900 steelworkers’ jobs – and those of several hundred contractors – at risk by announcing it was pulling out of Scunthorpe. Shortly before Christmas 88 years of steel production in the town ceased when the local plant was mothballed. Although Greybull Capital, a private equity firm, seems on the verge of buying the business after producing a last-ditch rescue plan, the future remains uncertain.“With all that’s gone on with the steelworks, people here have been having a hard time lately,” says Laird in his soft Somerset accent. “So it’s great for the whole town to come together, descend on Chelsea and have a really good time. That’s the special thing about football, it unites people and acts as a diversion from their problems.”As the man behind a proposed £40m community leisure development centred around a brand new ground for Scunthorpe, the chairman, Peter Swann, also hopes to make a more material difference. “The owner’s blueprint for the club, and the whole town, was a big reason why I came here,” says Laird.This attempt to embrace a wider vision has led Scunthorpe to shun shirt advertising, with players instead wearing the Prostate Cancer UK logo on their chests. Swann hopes to be able to negotiate another charity deal next summer as a Championship chairman but the team’s current position, mid-table in League One, remains a source of frustration.“With the squad we’ve got, we’ve definitely under-achieved,” says Laird. “Hopefully Sunday can really kick us on and convince us we can get the points needed to push into the play-offs. Playing for Mark Robins is really enjoyable but we haven’t been at our best for him yet. We need to put that right.”As Laird sits in a function room overlooking the rain-drenched Glanford Park pitch, Robins occupies an office down the corridor. Inside it, he is embarking on yet another round of interviews about that FA Cup goal against Nottingham Forest 26 years ago which quite possibly saved Sir Alex Ferguson’s job at Manchester United.Laird’s favourite Cup memory involves embarrassing Alan Pardew, Joey Barton and company in that 3-1 defeat of Newcastle, with the shine only slightly tarnished by an incident after the final whistle involving a drunken home supporter spilling on to the pitch, punching him in the face and subsequently being sent to prison. “It was upsetting,” he acknowledges. “But it was still a great game.”Now the challenge is to reprise Bradford’s achievement at Stamford Bridge last year when they shocked a certain Portuguese by winning 4-2. “It’s a bit disappointing not to be playing a José Mourinho side,” concedes Laird. “Guus Hiddink’s not done too badly though, has he? Chelsea have world-class players but, like Bradford last year, we’re going there to win. Dreams do come true sometimes.”Should he score he can expect to be presented with a one pound coin by his grandmother. “It’s something she did to encourage me as a kid and it’s a tradition that’s most definitely going to continue,” says Laird. “As a professional I’ve earned £40 but, in total, I’d have around £100 now – if only I hadn’t spent most of it on packets of sweets.”

Sepp Blatter and Michel Platini set to appeal against Fifa suspensions
~~AUTHOR~~
Owen Gibson
~CONTENTS~
The disgraced Fifa president Sepp Blatter and his Uefa counterpart Michel Platini are next week set to launch appeals against their eight-year bans from football after receiving the written reasons for the rulings.The adjudicatory chamber of Fifa’s ethics committee said on Saturday that it had fulfilled its promise of providing both men with the full written reasons for their ban by the middle of January.Platini, the former Uefa president who was the strong favourite to succeed Blatter until both became mired in a Swiss criminal investigation over a £1.35m “disloyal payment”, immediately confirmed he would appeal on Monday to Fifa’s appeals committee and Blatter is expected to follow suit.While the appeals committee is expected to uphold the ruling of the ethics committee, that stage is necessary before both men can appeal to the court of arbitration for sport for a final ruling. Given the likely timeline, Platini last week conceded that he will not be able to stand in the race for the Fifa presidency for which he was once firm favourite.Both have denied any wrongdoing over the £1.35m payment, made in 2011 at a time when Blatter was seeking re-election for work completed by the Frenchman when advising the longstanding Fifa president nine years earlier.Shortly before Christmas, the ethics committee ruled that both men had broken a range of ethics rules around transparency, conflict of interest and failing to uphold their fiduciary duties.Blatter protested his innocence after the ruling, insisting he was “not ashamed” and vowing to return in time for the 26 February extraordinary congress at which his successor will be chosen.Platini, who also denied wrongdoing despite admitting there was only ever an oral contract over the payment, condemned the proceedings as a “pure masquerade ... rigged to tarnish my name by bodies I know well”.But neither man had been able to provide a written contract for the £1.35m or definitively explain away why it was eventually paid in 2011, a few weeks before a presidential election at a time when Blatter was facing a challenge from the Qatari Mohamed bin Hammam.Platini acted as a special adviser to Blatter from 1998 to 2002. The Frenchman has claimed Blatter told him at the time that Fifa could not afford to pay him, despite the governing body making £78m over that four-year cycle, and did not want to break its wage structure.Blatter and Platini have said they believed their verbal contract was legal under Swiss law. However, Swiss law places a five-year time limit on such payments.The investigatory arm of the ethics committee had asked for life bans on the basis that Platini and Blatter were also guilty of corruption, but the adjudicatory arm failed to uphold that part of the recommended sanction.

Melbourne City end Western Sydney Wanderers' lengthy unbeaten streak
~CONTENTS~
A late Harry Novillo winner has inserted Melbourne City into the A-League championship conversation and snapped Western Sydney’s lengthy unbeaten streak.City emerged 3-2 winners from a pulsating match which swung in the breeze before settling in favour of John van ‘t Schip’s side.Sydney FC beat Newcastle Jets as Ali Abbas scores on comeback from injury Read moreFirst half strikes from Novillo and golden boot leader Bruno Fornaroli set City on their way.Two gaffes either side of halftime allowed the Wanderers to regain parity.Mitch Nichols rasped a volley through City keeper Thomas Sorensen’s fingers before Aaron Hughes scored an own goal from Romeo Castelen’s tricky cross.But in a match played in full voice, it was Novillo’s shout that mattered most.With just five minutes remaining, the winger rescued a lost ball and curled home past former City keeper Andrew Redmayne.The match reinforced the gains made by van ‘t Schip’s side this season.In the same fixture in November, City were swatted aside in a 3-0 loss that left them outside the top six.Since then, they have won five of seven matches to sit third and now must be thought of as genuine title contenders.The Dutchman showed his tactical nous by continuing a new formation with three at the back and moved Novillo up front with Fornaroli.By the half-hour mark, both had goals.A handball from Nikolai Topor-Stanley on the edge of the box brought both Aaron Mooy and Novillo around the set piece.The Frenchman took four steps and planted it beyond Redmayne, who endured catcalls all night after struggling with his distribution.Melbourne Victory snatch draw from jaws of loss to Central Coast Mariners Read moreOn 24 minutes, City made it two after Sorensen and Mooy fed Fornaroli in a lightning-quick transition.The Uruguayan had plenty to do but bought enough space between Scott Pepper and Andreu to curl past Redmayne for his 12th goal of the season.Against the tide, Western Sydney had a reply five minutes later. Mark Bridge’s opportunistic lob gave Nichols a one-on-one chance, which the in-form playmaker struck with full venom.The ball dipped enough to slip past Sorensen and into the net, a rare mistake from the veteran Dane since his Australian move.Tony Popovic hauled off marquee striker Federico Piovaccari after less than an hour, and within a minute his replacement left his mark.Castelen fizzed a cross from the right that Hughes could not leave alone and toed unfortunately into his own net.The Wanderers were in the ascendancy, with Sorensen keeping City on terms with a fabulous double save from Castelen and Bridge.Both sides swapped golden chances before Novillo emerged to win it and ending Western Sydney’s 10-game run without loss.

Sydney FC beat Newcastle Jets as Ali Abbas scores on comeback from injury
~CONTENTS~
Sydney FC winger Ali Abbas enjoyed a fairytale comeback from a knee reconstruction with a goal in his side’s 2-0 win over Newcastle at ANZ Stadium.For 80 minutes, Filip Holosko’s first-half goal was the only difference between a dominant Sydney outfit and a ragged Jets defence.Melbourne Victory snatch draw from jaws of loss to Central Coast Mariners Read moreBut Abbas, who substituted a cramping Holosko midway through the second half, sealed the full three points for the home side when he toed through a clever backheel from Matt Simon.The Iraqi international, who was playing his first A-League match in 405 days, immediately made a bee-line for club physio Andrew Clark on the sideline, where he was mobbed by the rest of his teammates.Abbas had credited Clark a number of times for helping him recover from two torn ligaments.The win in front of a crowd of 15,127 means Sydney temporarily join Brisbane and Western Sydney at the top of the A-League table and sets up a mouthwatering local derby against the Wanderers next week.For the toothless Jets, the loss extends their winless streak to 10 games, as well as a goal drought that now equals a record six matches.Holosko had earlier put his Jets’ demons to bed – he spurned five shots against them in round nine – with a clinical striker’s finish midway through the first half.First he showed the younger Nicholas Cowburn a clean pair of heels to get to a Ninkovic chip before beating the advancing Mark Birighitti for his third goal in two weeks.Graham Arnold’s men had the measure of their opposition for most of the first half, limiting the visitors to a single half-chance and spending the majority of the half in Jets territory.Sky Blues youngster George Blackwood had a supreme chance to break his A-League duck, but his left-footed effort grazed the far post midway through the first half.

Melbourne Victory snatch draw from jaws of loss to Central Coast Mariners
~CONTENTS~
Melbourne Victory’s dour run of A-League results has not convinced coach Kevin Muscat to look to the transfer market for a fast fix.On Friday night, Victory were diabolical against Central Coast Mariners in the first half, conceding three times against the league’s bottom club.Central Coast's Anthony Caceres in talks about move to Manchester City Read moreA three-goal recovery to earn a 3-3 draw spared Victory’s blushes but did little to improve the club’s chances of retaining the premier’s plate.Victory have taken just five points in seven matches since November; a run only matched by their opponents in Geelong, the last-placed Central Coast, and Newcastle.Despite their dire straights, Muscat says he’ll resist shaking up his side and rely on the return to fitness of three grand final winners.He named Archie Thompson, Nick Ansell and Carl Valeri as the men who could make a difference on the run-in.“Three handy players,” Muscat said.“Getting them all back and getting them back firing, it’s almost as good as fresh faces. [New signing] Jai [Ingham] coming in too, he’ll add something to the squad.“As for anything else, we’re monitoring things but doing things off a knee jerk reaction is not the right thing to do.”Against Central Coast, Thompson scored his first goal in seven months, while Ansell returned to the pitch for the first time since May’s title decider.But it’s Valeri which could be the key to Victory’s recovery.The 31-year-old adds stability to the champions that’s been missing since he was taken ill with a virus in early December.Valeri has been given as much time as he needs to recover by the club but Muscat reported good news on his comeback.“In the last few days, he’s encouraged us with the way he’s been presenting. He feels better in himself,” he said.A-League transfer window sees signings for Melbourne City and Victory Read more“I’d love to have Carl available simply because it means his health is good.”After Besart Berisha sealed their stunning comeback with two minutes remaining, Muscat admitted to being exhilarated and exasperated.“We re-found that confidence, that desire,” he said.“The application, the work ethic to put a team on the back foot and work really hard for one another. On the flipside, I can’t help but think what a contrast the first half was.“You can’t expect to win a football game based on defending like that.”Central Coast hope they have regained the A-League’s respect as coach Tony Walmsley revealed the depth of their financial strain.The Mariners backed up a drought-breaking win over Wellington Phoenix with a stunning first-half display against Victory.While their 3-0 lead was reeled in by the A-League champions, Walmsley could sideline his emotions from a rollercoaster match and see merit in the hard-earned point.“We’ve kept a steeliness about how we’re going about our business,” he said.“It’s for other people to say whether we’ve gained more respect over the last two weeks but I’m incredibly proud of what the team’s delivered.”Walmsley said the nature of the club’s financial position meant every player at the club wears a ‘for sale’ sign.“The club has built its foundations on development of youth and sale of youth ... when that presents itself, with the financial restraints we’ve got we have to go with it,” he said.“We’re spending $1.2 million less [than last year] ... we’re spending the floor of the [salary] cap. I’m embracing the challenge with working with players at the floor of the cap until we can make the club sustainable.”

Guus Hiddink: Diego Costa and Oscar like bulls in Chelsea training clash
~~AUTHOR~~
David Hytner
~CONTENTS~
Guus Hiddink likened Oscar and Diego Costa to charging bulls during their training ground bust-up on Thursday but Chelsea’s interim manager suggested he was not unhappy to see their passions stirred.Hiddink, who said that Oscar had apologised to the rest of the squad afterwards – it was his retaliatory tackle on Costa that sparked the incident – has gone on record to say that certain Chelsea players have relied too heavily on their natural talent this season, at the expense of commitment. Oscar is one who has fitted that category.Hiddink would much rather have to calm down over-heated players than have to gee them up and he sought to cast Thursday’s flashpoint in a positive light, particularly in relation to Oscar.“I liked it very much when he put the emotion in [on Thursday], although he went over the top,” Hiddink said. “But when this guy puts the emotion in, then automatically his level of play rises. So we try to punch him every now and then to get him on this level.“It’s good that they are showing commitment. I like it more when I have to put the brake on and say: ‘Hey guys, come on. Control. Emotion down.’ And we go on. When you have to push people, the motivation is too low.”Oscar and Costa have looked revitalised since Hiddink took over from José Mourinho last month and the team go into Sunday’s FA Cup tie at home to Scunthorpe United in confident mood, having pieced together four matches without defeat, three of them under Hiddink.Oscar, though, overstepped the mark on Thursday, when he clattered into the back of Costa. The striker had earlier gone in strongly on him. The pair squared up and they had to be calmed down by team-mates, who were on hand. But they made their peace quickly.“Oscar apologised in front of the group,” Hiddink said. “He wanted to speak. I said: ‘Take the podium.’ He apologised for his over-reacting and then they looked at each other and they started laughing.“It was a pity that our photographer had the day off because he could have shot beautiful pictures from the two, let’s say, bulls, who were chesting a bit after a charge from behind from the smaller bull, which was Oscar.“It was overdone, especially when you know Oscar. He is not the biggest tackler of the team and he got Diego. They stumbled over the ground, stood up as a normal reaction and then chested a bit, without any further serious threat of punching or whatever. It was more the threat of two bulls.”Hiddink, 69, has seen it all before and he said most managers would have to deal with “four, five or six” serious incidents during their careers. “The toughest time I’ve had was in my first spell at PSV Eindhoven,” Hiddink said. “We went all the way through the European Cup and I had very strong characters like [Eric] Gerets, [Soren] Lerby and Ronald Koeman.“They were very eager to win and they liked to go on the edge. I like that very much. There were also a few who were very, very [difficult]. As a manager, you have to react rather well.”Hiddink reported that César Azpilicueta had a small fracture to his jaw, and there was a flash of deadpan humour. “Oscar did it,” Hiddink said. “He punched him. Watch Oscar. No, Azpi was kicked in the face at Crystal Palace last Sunday. Maybe, he has to wear a mask and we will have two Zorros, with him and [Nemanja] Matic.”

Manuel Pellegrini hopes FA Cup win will galvanise Manchester City
~~AUTHOR~~
Richard Rae
~CONTENTS~
When it comes to the domestic competitions, said Manuel Pellegrini, January may be the key month of the season. That is obviously so in the cups but Manchester City’s manager was making the point that maximising the return from their Premier League fixtures before they return to Champions League action next month is likely to have a huge bearing on the destination of the title in May.With Sergio Agüero back close to his best up front and the teenager Kelechi Iheanacho once again demonstrating his huge potential alongside the Argentinian, City had this Cup tie against a remarkably timid Norwich settled within half an hour.So superior were they, in fact, that it would have been understandable if Pellegrini’s thoughts in the dug-out during the second half were about the three Premier League games they now face before the second leg of their Capital One Cup semi-final against Everton at the Etihad Stadium on 27 January. Home games against Everton and Crystal Palace this week are followed by a trip to West Ham.“We have two teams ahead of us, so it’s the moment to try to reduce that gap,” said Pellegrini. “In February you start again the Champions League and continue the FA Cup, maybe final of Capital One – so I think this month will be key.”In that respect confirmation that Agüero has regained form as well as fitness could not be more timely. The striker’s goal was an individual classic as he surged past four would-be tacklers and into the penalty area before poking the ball past the Norwich goalkeeper, John Ruddy. It was his 11th goal of a season in which he has made only 13 league appearances and he then set up Iheanacho for City’s second, side-footed first time beyond Ruddy with the calm certainty of a natural goal-scorer.On Iheanacho, whose goal meant he has scored five times in around 360 minutes of first-team football this season, Pellegrini said the young Nigeria international was demonstrating why he did not need to go into the transfer market this month.“We had a lot of criticism when we didn’t replace Álvaro Negredo but I think when you have a young player that has the condition that Kelechi has he deserves the option.”Despite making seven changes Pellegrini said only Kevin De Bruyne – who came on as a second-half substitute and ensured the score-line more accurately reflected the visitors’ dominance of the game – had been rested but that the midfielders Yaya Touré, David Silva and Fernandinho were all expected to be available for Wednesday.Man of the match Sergio Agüero (Manchester CityManchester City ease past Norwich City as Sergio Agűero shows his class Read more

Bournemouth’s Eddie Howe sees squad rotation vindicated at Birmingham
~~AUTHOR~~
Peter Lansley
~CONTENTS~
It seems harsh after a period in which his team have beaten Chelsea and Manchester United, reached the fourth round of the FA Cup and completed a record £10m-plus transfer but Eddie Howe acknowledges Bournemouth’s fate may hinge on the next fortnight.Before the next round of the Cup, the Premier League’s 16th-placed side host West Ham United and Norwich City and visit Sunderland. Maintain their current form, with the assistance of the new signings Benik Afobe and Juan Iturbe, and Bournemouth could be sailing into clear blue water.Glenn Murray rescues Bournemouth with late Cup winner at Birmingham City Read moreBefore Afobe completed his switch from Wolverhampton Wanderers on Sunday, Howe already had plenty of cause for optimism. The former Arsenal and England Under-21s striker should be available for the two home games in five days this week – though Iturbe is still awaiting international clearance after his loan move from Roma – and, after resting his entire first XI to win their third round tie at St Andrew’s, Howe is conscious that his team could be even better off than their current status four points clear of the relegation zone.“It is a big period coming up for us,” Howe said. “We are well aware of the importance of the games and that’s why we felt it was prudent to make the changes [for Saturday] we did. We can’t underestimate the [importance] of the next few weeks in terms of our destiny this season. We want to make sure the players we have are fresh enough to do themselves justice in the schedule coming up.”Glenn Murray, Bournemouth’s matchwinner at Stamford Bridge last month, again contributed the decisive goal, five minutes from time after coming on as a substitute. Lee Tomlin had equalised from the penalty spot after Michael Morrison, the Birmingham captain, had given the Championship side the lead.“It highlights the strength of the squad that we were able to win at Birmingham. It was always going to be a tough game,” Howe added. “That’s one defeat in nine which is a good run of form for us and if we can continue that we should have no problems.”Howe’s rotation policy has already been vindicated by this victory but while he admitted he would continue to rest his Premier League team for Cup games, he criticised the powers that be for arranging another full set of league fixtures immediately after the next round as well as this.“If the FA Cup wants to be considered the best cup competition in the world, and keep its standing in English football, I’m not sure that is the wisest thing to do,” he said. “It does force your hand to a degree. Today we went to extremes to protect the players who will potentially play this week.”Birmingham also made seven changes but were an entirely different proposition from the team Gary Rowett, their manager, inherited 15 months ago immediately after an 8-0 defeat by these opponents. A well organised and spirited side have a top-six Championship finish within their grasp.Man of the match Marc Pugh (Bournemouth)

Steve McClaren urges patience for ‘lonely’ Newcastle after FA Cup exit
~~AUTHOR~~
James Riach
~CONTENTS~
Steve McClaren has urged Newcastle United’s supporters to keep faith with his players, saying the team were in a lonely place at Watford after fans voiced their discontent at another early Cup exit.Under Mike Ashley’s ownership the north-east club have not progressed past the fourth round of the competition in nine seasons. McClaren selected a strong side in an attempt to end that unwanted record but, although Newcastle dominated for large periods, they spurned a series of opportunities and, in contrast, Troy Deeney took Watford’s only chance.Newcastle have been beaten 1-0 in their last four matches and are one of the lowest scorers in the Premier League, although there were reasons for McClaren to be optimistic. They were undone by a lack of sharpness in attack – Ayoze Pérez shot wide from an excellent position in the first half before Moussa Sissoko shanked an effort inside the penalty area.McClaren’s side play Manchester United in the league on Tuesday night following a frustrating afternoon that ended with Newcastle’s fans deriding the French winger Florian Thauvin and jeering the whole team.Asked if he thought the chants were harsh, McClaren said: “I thought so. That’s my honest opinion and I said that to the players. We’ve all got stick together through this. It’s a lonely place in the dressing room when we lose and you’re getting a bit of stick. But we have just got to stick together.Jermaine Jenas officially confirms his retirement from football Read more“I can’t ask any more of those players – they have given everything they possibly could. We’re creating, we’re going forward, we’re attacking, we’re controlling the game, we had chances to win and we haven’t so we just move on.“It’s a big game on Tuesday. These players haven’t got down at all and I don’t expect them to on Tuesday either. What we need is 50,000 supporters right behind us from the first whistle because it is going to be a tough game. But you have seen the quality we have got and the way we play football. The effort and the attitude is there. We went for the win here and we have to go for it again against United.”Chants against Ashley’s ownership are not uncommon, but the sense of frustration in the away end was palpable. Thauvin was told he was not fit to wear the shirt after limping to the sidelines, and few Newcastle players were applauded at the final whistle.Transfer window wishlists: who Premier League fans want to sign this winter Read moreThey are third bottom in the league having scored 19 goals in 20 games this season, in desperate need of some life in attack. However, McClaren said he would leave any potential transfer dealings to others. “I’ll leave any movement to other people. I’ve got to get this team ready. We’ve got players injured, we’ve only one striker at the present moment and the other is an 18-year-old kid. We haven’t got the luxury of having two or three strikers to pick from. We just have to keep going.“You have got to stick the ball in the back of the net and you have to defend the other side. Now we’ve been doing that but not scoring. We had a new formation, we controlled the game against a top team with a strong home record and we really only gave them one opportunity. We’re not far away but when you look at it we are.”Watford, who play Southampton on Wednesday, made four changes from last weekend’s defeat to Manchester City, Quique Sánchez Flores leaving Odion Ighalo on the bench. Deeney capitalised on some abject defending from Newcastle one minute before half-time, intercepting a terrible pass from Georginio Wijnaldum and calmly rounding the goalkeeper, Rob Elliot.Flores denied the striker would be allowed to leave this month, saying: “I’m confident we will keep Troy as he is loyal and doesn’t have a sense to change [clubs] in the middle of the season.“The work of Ighalo uses a lot of energy so it was important to give him a break. Troy is different as he plays a lot with his heart. It’s great that he wants to play. Players like Deeney are so important to this club.“Our main objective is to stay in this league. If we are in the top 10 it’s better than the bottom half. But we are competitive and we will want to win every game. We have to manage the squad. December was tough, January is tough and February will be tougher. We have to be careful.”Man of the match Moussa Sissoko (Newcastle)

Former Swansea striker Michu rebuilding career in Spain’s fourth tier
~~AUTHOR~~
Sid Lowe
~CONTENTS~
“I lasted 60 minutes and then my ankle said: ‘Enough.’” Michu walked off the pitch that night in Bern and did not walk back on again until last Thursday night in Langreo, 441 days later and a long way away. The Premier League’s top scorer at Christmas 2012, an international with the world champions Spain in 2013, he started 2014 in the Champions League with Napoli; now, aged 29, after a series of operations on his right ankle, he hopes to restart his career from the bottom with Unión Popular de Langreo in Spain’s regionalised fourth tier.Zinedine Zidane is a change for the better at Real Madrid, says Luca Modric Read moreMichu’s last game was at the Wankdorf stadium in the Europa League. More than a year later he finally played again, at Ganzábal alongside the river Nalón in the wet, green hills of Asturias, surrounded by mines and foundries; an artificial pitch with a municipal swimming pool at one end of the ground and a block of flats at the other. His return came in a 3-0 win over Club Deportivo Covadonga in Spain’s Tercera, a league with 17 divisions, down below Primera, Segunda and the 80-team Segunda B, itself split between four regionalised groups.Langreo’s manager calls them “amateur”, although some players are paid fees of up to €500 a month. Michu is not one of them. The captain of Covadonga is Negredo; not Álvaro but his brother César. When Michu came off in Bern, he was replaced by Marek Hamsik; when he goes on here, wearing 16, he replaces Carlos Viesca, a 23-year-old striker. Seven hundred and 16 people are there to see it.At one end, someone has hung six Michu shirts over a barrier: Oviedo, Rayo Vallecano, Napoli, Swansea City home and away and Spain. Diego Cervero is here – the captain of second division Real Oviedo is among Michu’s closest friends, with whom he began his career 20km away at the Carlos Tartiere stadium. Michu’s father is here, too, and so is the player’s brother, Hernán Pérez Cuesta. He really could not miss this: Hernán Pérez is Langreo’s coach.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Michu fans display some of the shirts that he has worn throughout his career. Photograph: Eloy AlonsoMichu began training with Langreo in the summer. He was still owned by Swansea and there were offers to go to first division clubs in Spain and interest from England, too, but Michu knew that he was not right and that joining them would not be right either. “You have to be honourable in life,” he says. Instead, he began a process of rehabilitation that he knew might fail following another operation. There is little cartilage left in his right ankle, leaving bone against bone. “I don’t remember what it is like to be pain-free,” he says.Hernán Pérez, his brother and coach, says: “He has suffered terribly: many people would have thrown in the towel already.” Langreo offered Michu a place to train and, eventually, to play. So, too, did Covadonga. Their manager, Fermín Álvarez, knows Michu from Oviedo, where Michu made his debut aged 17, in the same Tercera to which he has returned 12 years later.Covadonga also agreed to move the game from 3 January to Thursday night, so Michu could play. Although he rescinded his contract with Swansea, he had to wait until the transfer window opened to be able to formally register with the Royal Asturias Football Federation. He had hoped to play in November; now, at last, he could. On the way on to the pitch, a slogan is painted above the door: “We’re in this together.” Michu says later: “There are no words to express how grateful I am to everyone.”Michu turns up a little before 6pm, an hour and a half before kick-off, a bag slung over his shoulder. He is nervous; more nervous, he later admits, than when he visited Old Trafford or Anfield. “I couldn’t sleep last night; I couldn’t even take a siesta this afternoon, and I always have,” he says. “It seems strange that I couldn’t control my emotions but that’s the way it is.”He starts on the bench, photographers gathering to take pictures. But at half-time he is out there warming up with Álvaro Vázquez, the physical coach. In the 48th minute, at 8.39pm, with the score at 1-0, he comes on. Slowly, he eases his way into the game. Playing just behind the forwards, he has a couple of chances, one that he hits over, another that he passes instead of taking on. A volley flies past the post. He provides two assists that are ruled out by the linesman and starts the moves that lead to the second and third goals.

Photograph: Fernando Rodríguez/La Nueva EspañaAt the full-time whistle, he heads straight to the dressing room, the first off. He is not comfortable with the attention but things have gone well.“It was a special day,” his brother and coach says. “Even if you have played in huge stadiums, that feeling you get as a footballer is the same everywhere and you need it. He had not played for a long time. Above all, we have to recover him emotionally. Hopefully he will be better with every game and we’ll see how far he can go. The president said he can stay here for as long as he wants and go when he wants. Let’s see how his ankle responds, let’s see if we can lift him emotionally – and then whatever will be, will be.”For now, what Michu wants to be is happy, a footballer. His ankle does not feel entirely comfortable but he does not expect it to. “There’s always some pain. I hardly know what it is like to play without pain but I felt good,” he says. “It’s been so long. I remember my last game … it was an artificial pitch and I lasted 60 minutes and then my ankle said: ‘Enough.’ Now I hope to rise again. I’m not really planning anything: enjoy the next session, then play a bit longer in the next game. Then we’ll see if I can compete at a higher level or not.”There are still doubts, then? “Yes.”He adds: “I can play. The problem is: what level? I would love to reach the level I was at again, or who knows if even higher, but it will be difficult, I know that. I came here to be happy. It’s football, whatever level you’re at. I’m playing, competing. Long-term plans? None. Tomorrow I train and on Sunday we play Lugones.”

Jürgen Klopp warns Pep Guardiola: England is football, football, football
~~AUTHOR~~
Andy Hunter
~CONTENTS~
Jürgen Klopp has said the only advice he can give Pep Guardiola about the Premier League is to prepare for a draining fixture schedule, admitting he was unaware the Capital One Cup semi-final was over two legs before he arrived at Liverpool.The manager lamented the addition of another game to an already hectic programme after drawing at Exeter City in the FA Cup third round on Friday. Liverpool’s Europa League campaign also resumes next month and he believes the intensity of the fixture list, not the intensity of his playing style or training methods, is culpable for Anfield’s extensive injury list.Jürgen Klopp to pick callow Liverpool side again for Exeter Cup replay Read moreKlopp received congratulatory messages from friends in Germany following Liverpool’s Capital One Cup semi-final win at Stoke City last week. They assumed he had led Liverpool to Wembley with the 1-0 first leg win at the Britannia Stadium and have also been surprised that drawn FA Cup ties result in a replay rather than extra time and penalties. Asked what advice he would give to Guardiola, who has announced his intention to leave the Bundesliga for the Premier League this summer, the former Borussia Dortmund coach said: “I don’t have to tell Pep Guardiola anything because he is that experienced. [But] the number of games is the biggest difference. When I came here, I didn’t know there were two rounds in the semi-final of the Capital One Cup. I had people in Germany last week saying: ‘Yeah, you’re in the final again!’ Idiots!“In Germany, when you tell people about the FA Cup that if you draw you play again they say: ‘What?’ Here you have penalties and extra time, but only after the second game. That’s the thing, the number of games – football, football, football. With a perfect pre-season you are prepared for a long, long journey. We knew about it, but to feel it is different. “Pep is so experienced, for sure. I’m sure he will buy a few players and have a good team, have 35 players or whatever! What I can say about here is very positive. It’s a great country, great people, the food is much better than everybody said and the weather is not great, like everyone said.”Liverpool have recalled the goalkeeper Danny Ward from his loan spell at Aberdeen after impressing while in Scotland.

Antoine Griezmann and Yannick Carrasco each conjured moments of magic as Atlético Madrid recaptured top spot in La Liga from Barcelona with a hard-fought 2-0 victory at Celta Vigo.Chances were scarce on a heavy Balaídos stadium pitch sodden with rain but Griezmann and Carrasco scored excellent goals to lift Atlético two points clear of Barça.Real Madrid’s Gareth Bale saddened by Benítez exit but basks in Zidane acclaim Read moreLuis Enrique’s reigning champions won 4-0 at home to Granada on Saturday and have a game in hand over their main rivals at the halfway stage of the season.Griezmann sent Luciano Vietto clear on the left four minutes into the second half and raced into the penalty area to sidefoot the Argentinian’s low centre past the stranded Celta goalkeeper, Sergio Álvarez, the France forward’s 10th La Liga goal of the season.With fifth-placed Celta pressing for an equaliser, the Atlético substitute Carrasco picked up a loose ball 10 minutes from time and galloped forward before cracking a shot high into the net.Atlético, who have conceded a mere eight goals, have 44 points from 19 matches, with Barcelona on 42 from 18 games.“We knew it would be a tough game as Celta play the ball around well,” Griezmann told Spanish television. “But we were strong at the back and we know that when we have chances up front we can score at any moment.“At the back and in attack we are doing things well and we have to keep it going.“

Beleaguered Bolton take respite from Darren Pratley rescue at Eastleigh
~~AUTHOR~~
Sachin Nakrani
~CONTENTS~
Normally, scoring a late equaliser against a team three divisions and 53 places below you would not be something to rejoice in. But there is very little normal about life at Bolton Wanderers right now and so it was perhaps no surprise that those involved with the club took much out of leaving this mud-soaked venue with a draw.The immediate relief lay in avoiding being on the receiving end of what would have the biggest shock of the FA Cup third round, yet for the visitors the significance of Darren Pratley’s 87th-minute close-range strike ran deeper, providing them with respite in what has been a nightmare season for the four-times winners of this competition. Bolton sit bottom of the Championship, are £185m in debt and have been served a winding-up order by HMRC, the hearing for which takes place a week on 18 January.Eastleigh denied Cup glory by Bolton’s Darren Pratley but earn replay Read moreNeil Lennon, the Bolton manager, confirmed here that Zach Clough and Mark Davies, two of his best players, are likely to be sold this month to ease their financial plight – to Bristol City and Sheffield Wednesday, respectively – but that may not be enough and ultimately the club could enter administration, making a second relegation in four years a near certainty. This result was, then, a bright spot amid the incessant gloom.“Things on and off the pitch have not been going well for Bolton so it would’ve been hard for us if we had gone out of the FA Cup as well,” said Pratley, the club captain. “I probably haven’t scored an uglier goal but it could be really important financially because we need the money that comes from staying in the hat. We need the money as much as Eastleigh and I said to one of their players afterwards that a draw will get both clubs some money, maybe a televised game [for the replay], and that can help keep us afloat.”What Bolton desperately require is a takeover, yet despite interested parties speaking with Trevor Birch, the insolvency practitioner hired by the owner, Eddie Davies, to find a buyer, little progress has been made. Until that occurs, players will continue to be sold – Lennon hinted the midfielder Josh Vela will follow Clough and Davies out of the club during the transfer window – and the supporters will remain in a state of angst, as was clear among the 1,000-plus who were in attendance here. They cheered their team on, and deserve huge credit for making the long journey south, but it did not take much for them to turn on the players and the manager.“I live in Bolton so I can see the passion of the fans and they obviously want the club to do well and be stable, so the quicker we get sorted the better for everyone,” said Pratley. “What’s going on isn’t nice. We’ve only missed one month’s salary [the players were not paid in November] so we can’t be too down. But we’re human beings and we’ve got families. People say footballers get paid a lot but I don’t think anyone in our team has got enough money to live on after football. I for one am not here for a holiday – if we lose or play bad, it affects me. But we all have to stay strong.”Bolton certainly had to show strength during this contest, one that almost did not go ahead because of the deluge of rain that has fallen in Hampshire recently. It took three pitch inspections for the referee, Iain Williamson, to decide conditions were satisfactory enough for play to commence but even then large patches of mud were noticeable across the surface.Up for sale and out of money: what on earth has gone wrong at Bolton? Read moreLennon described the pitch as “one of the worst I’ve ever seen” and one can only imagine his level of fury upon seeing Eastleigh deservedly take the lead through Dorian Dervite’s 51st-minute own goal. Expectations grew among the 5,250 crowd, a record attendance for this venue, only for Pratley to deal them a late blow.This was still a day to cherish for Eastleigh, who entered the third round as the only non-league team left in the FA Cup and now have a replay at the Macron Stadium later this month to look forward to. Not bad for a club who were playing in the Wessex League as recently as 2003.“This tie is not dead,” insisted the Eastleigh chairman, Stewart Donald, whose investment in the club since taking over in 2012 has not only led to them making a name for themselves in the FA Cup but also pushing hard for promotion from the National League to the Football League this season. “The only worry is that this tie acts as a shop window. We have some very good players and others will now see that too.”Man of the match Jai Reason (Eastleigh)

Peter Crouch desperate for more game time after rare Stoke City outing
~~AUTHOR~~
Richard Gibson
~CONTENTS~
Mark Hughes’s preference for false No9s this season has left his conventional one frustrated and contemplating a future elsewhere. Peter Crouch might sport the No25 shirt but he is an old-fashioned English centre-forward in every other sense. However, the 34-year-old’s attributes have proved surplus to requirements in the Stoke evolution.Past the halfway point in the Premier League season the former England international is yet to start a league match. So knockout football has proved his refuge and with the twinkle-toed trio of Bojan Krkic, Xherdan Shaqiri and Marko Arnautovic left in the Potteries at the weekend, he marked only his fourth start in 2015-16 with the opening goal as Stoke booked a seventh consecutive appearance in the FA Cup fourth round.Crouch has scored more Premier League goals than Dennis Bergkamp and Cristiano Ronaldo but has been left frustrated at his lack of opportunity to add to his tally. Now, in the twilight of his career, he is desperate for more game time.“That’s the thing. I do want to be playing. If I can’t play here then maybe I do have to move on. At the moment all I can do is work hard and try and get back in the team,” Crouch said.Stoke City weigh up making bid for West Brom’s Saido Berahino Read more“There’s been times when it has been hard. When you’re running on the pitch after games, you’ve been watching but haven’t been part of it. You say that you’re part of it, of course, but it doesn’t feel like it at times and to be training when the other lads are resting can be very frustrating. Those are the times when you have to dig deep and be strong mentally, but hopefully I’ve proved I can come in and do a job when required.“I played 33 or 34 Premier League games last season so to have not featured this season has been very frustrating. All I can do is try and take the opportunities when I’m given them and try and force my way back in. We’re a top-10 Premier League side. I’d like to stay and be a part of that, obviously.”Hughes, who made nine changes here with Wednesday’s Premier League match at home to Norwich in mind, insists Crouch remains part of his plans.“We gave him a new contract at the beginning of the year so I think that shows how much we value him. I would like to give him more game time but sometimes it’s not possible, other players are playing well, the team is functioning well and you have to be patient. When I do give him opportunities you hope he comes in and shows his quality.”Crouch did just that with the classy finishing touch to Joselu’s precise cross on the quarter-hour. A dozen minutes into the second half his blushes were saved after he failed to untangle his feet, but Jonathan Walters drove in Stoke’s second seconds later.In between the visitors’ goals League One Doncaster belied the 45 places between the teams with some incisive passing and the better chances. Nathan Tyson equalised from their best move, turning in at the second attempt, and their general play suggested their pursuit of a play-off place is not out of the question.“Sometimes you find one team comes out of the pack and goes on a run and if we were to continue what we’ve done in the previous 12 games we probably would do it. But it would have to be one hell of a run,” said the manager, Darren Ferguson, whose side are six points off sixth place.“The fans have been entertained which is really important, they are seeing good football and a bunch of lads really having a go. We just hope more come in to see the nitty gritty of the league games.”Man of the match Craig Alcock (Doncaster)

Manchester United’s dismal display increases discontent with Louis van Gaal
~~AUTHOR~~
Jamie Jackson
~CONTENTS~
The hollow football remains and Louis van Gaal still appears to be out of ideas and inspiration. His Manchester United side are in Monday night’s FA Cup fourth round draw but the sense is of Van Gaal being a dismal defeat away from the same scrutiny he suffered during the festive period.Next is Tuesday evening’s visit to Newcastle United, then Sunday’s trip to Merseyside to face Liverpool. Both sides are struggling, so to go down to Steve McClaren’s men or United’s fiercest rivals will not play well with Ed Woodward, the executive vice-chairman, or supporters.Against Sheffield United of League One, the Dutchman’s team were lacklustre and fortunate to win. Only a late Wayne Rooney penalty dragged United through the teatime game in which Memphis Depay drew ironic cheers for actually taking aim at George Long’s goal. As Depay was a 60th-minute substitute and his shot went wide this is an apt illustration of the home crowd’s deep frustration.Afterwards, the bona fide United great Paul Scholes, who knows about entertaining the Theatre of Dreams, spoke of players and Van Gaal seeming bored. Ennui is indeed the prevailing emotion emanating from this United squad. The Van Gaal factor becalms his players and the fans who pay a sizeable amount to watch them.There were only 20 minutes remaining when a man in a red shirt finally managed to shoot at the target. There was little surprise, though, that Matteo Darmian’s effort proved tame and was simple for Long to collect.The Italian offers a prime example of Van Gaal’s puzzling modus operandi. On joining from Torino, Darmain operated smoothly from his right full-back berth, looking a classy addition to the squad. But since then he has been played at left-back and centre-back, dropped, criticised publicly and become another Van Gaal signing to whom the 64-year-old offers mixed messages.Darmian, who cost £13m in the summer, was clear in his understanding of fans’ frustration at the grey product they are watching. This was the 10th consecutive home match in which United failed to score in the first half.“Of course, we want to score earlier in games as well,” Darmian said. “But sometimes it is difficult for us because Sheffield, like a lot of teams when they come here, have all their team behind the ball and it is not easy to find space. Sometimes we tried to pass the ball in behind to create the space.“The fans were fantastic because we didn’t score [before the penalty] and they still supported. We want to do our best for the fans but know it is not easy.”Rooney was the game-winner for a second Saturday in a row, after his back-heeled finish in the victory over Swansea City here. “He was very calm to take a penalty in the 92nd minute,” Darmian said. “But he’s a top player and he didn’t feel the pressure. It would have been better if we had scored earlier but we won the game and are in the next round.“This sort of game can always happen with a team from League One but we fight and in the end we got the penalty, we scored it, we won and we are happy with the result. Wins always help to increase our confidence. Now we have two days to prepare for Newcastle. We have to recover and then focus on that game.”Darmian does not seem too sure how Van Gaal views his progress. “Yes, I think he is happy and when I train I try to improve day by day. And when the manager gives me a chance I try to do my best and to help the team.”However, Italy’s right-back knows his preferred position. “On the right side. But playing on the left is not a problem when the coach wants me to play there. I always try to do my best wherever I play. To return after a hamstring injury [in early December] is not easy. Sometimes it affects you mentally. But I feel good. I want to play like I did at the beginning of the season and that is what I’m trying to do.“Now we have to continue in the way we have started the new year. We have beaten Swansea and won [against Sheffield United] and now we must continue in this way.”But how much longer can the Van Gaal way continue? The XI he fielded had Anthony Martial out of position again on the left. The 20-year-old possesses two qualities United sorely miss at the head of attack: serious pace and flair. So why not select him at centre-forward, and the ever-slowing Rooney behind? Afterwards Van Gaal spoke of needing more wing-play. Juan Mata is a fine footballer but no Stanley Matthews or even Ashley Young of the wide areas. Yet the Spaniard is continually deployed there. Why? Countless more questions such as these could be put to Van Gaal. Perhaps the most pertinent one is this: what happens regarding the Dutchman’s position if he fails to scrape wins in the next two games?Man of the match Memphis Depay (Manchester United)Paul Scholes: Manchester United players looked bored against Sheffield United Read more

Aston Villa subject of crisis talks in New York after poor show at Wycombe
~~AUTHOR~~
Daniel Taylor
~CONTENTS~
Aston Villa have called a crisis meeting in New York to discuss how they can save their season after another dismal weekend for the Premier League’s bottom club and with a growing mutiny among their disillusioned fanbase.The chief executive, Tom Fox, is flying out on Monday for talks with the owner, Randy Lerner, to see if there is any way the damage can be repaired by using the current transfer window to bring in new players.Fox will be accompanied by the sporting director, Hendrik Almstadt, on the back of the 1-1 draw against Wycombe Wanderers in the FA Cup on Saturday, when their failure to beat a League Two side culminated in angry scenes involving the away supporters. As well as chants of “You’re not fit to wear the shirt” towards the players, Villa’s fans also turned on the manager, Rémi Garde, who has now been in charge for 10 games without a victory.Garde’s players were abused as they boarded the team coach and, while the game was going on, the captain, Micah Richards, went behind the dugout to speak to a section of fans who had been venting their anger. Richards, who had been taken off with an injury, assured the supporters the players were trying their best. It was claimed on a Villa fan website that the captain intervened to calm the situation after two senior players told their own supporters to “fuck off”.Wycombe fight back against Aston Villa with Joe Jacobson spot-on Read moreWith the threat of a protest in the replay at Villa Park, Garde is hoping to be given the financial backing to make new signings. However, Villa’s position is so perilous the club are also acutely aware it will not be easy to attract players.“It’s important and I hope I will achieve that, I don’t know yet,” Garde said. “I’m still happy about the team, I’m still believing they are trying to do their best but at some point you have to recognise that if they are doing their best and we are still not winning then there is a problem.”Garde, who was targeted with chants of “You don’t know what you’re doing” after substituting Carles Gil, described himself as open to the idea of using a psychologist to help repair the players’ confidence. Yet, on his point about the players’ effort, there are statistics that show they are repeatedly outrun in matches.“I’ve got some players who, to be fair, are struggling with minor injuries,” Garde said. “They cannot train as much as I would like and then it’s a problem. But I know these figures and I’m concerned about that. Running is not the only way to win games. Football is not just athleticism, it’s a question of technique, tactics and mentality. But this is a very important point and every game the opponents are running more than us.“We have to be professional, we have to face our responsibility and do more. The level of the team is always impacted by one or two players not playing at their best. I didn’t see enough difference between the two squads. I’ve got a lot of respect for Wycombe, especially after the game, but we have to question ourselves and wonder why we didn’t win.”Man of the match Aaron Pierre (Wycombe)

Nikica Jelavic’s energy proves its worth to West Ham in win over Wolves

Alan Smith
~CONTENTS~
It has been far from plain sailing for Nikica Jelavic since joining West Ham United in September. The striker has had to bide his time for opportunities but on his 10th appearance, albeit only his second start, he finally broke his duck.Few would have been more pleased than his “biased” manager, Slaven Bilic, to see him score the winning goal in a game that looked destined to finish scoreless. They have known each other 14 years, since Jelavic joined Hajduk Split when Bilic was in charge, and also worked together with Croatia.Nikica Jelavic scores late for West Ham to defeat Wolves on dismal day Read moreBilic portrays Jelavic as the ultimate professional, a players’ player who is about more than just goals. Yet getting off the mark offers another timely boost. From a dearth of options due to injuries a month ago, Bilic’s quandary now is who to leave out of his team.“You could see how happy the players were to see Jela score,” Bilic said. “Maybe I am biased because I know him since he was 15 in the Hajduk academy but he is almost adored at the club because of the work-rate he has. His professionalism on and off the pitch, his relationship with the players is great. They were all delighted he scored a goal but he is not only about scoring. It is extremely important to open his locker, of course, it will help his confidence.”On Tuesday West Ham travel to Bournemouth, who broke their transfer record by signing Benik Afobe from Wolverhampton Wanderers for around £10m on Saturday. The reverse fixture ended in a 4-3 win for the south coast team but Bilic will not be motivated by revenge.“There is no place in the world for revenge in football, but they deserved that win,” Bilic said. “They run a lot, are a good side and are without any negative pressure. They are enjoying themselves. You can see that they are never afraid of playing and that’s why it’s very difficult to play against them.”The Wolves manager, Kenny Jackett, expects to sign a replacement for Afobe, their top scorer with 10 in all competitions, but could not guarantee he will be permitted to spend the entire fee. “We’re certainly looking for a replacement, you can never have enough strikers. It is difficult because we are reluctant to sell but he expressed his desire to go. The club is up for sale and the situation is what it is but we have a spirited group and we will try to make the right additions.”Bilic also indicated that West Ham considered signing the 22-year-old. “He had been mentioned to us as well. We looked at him, from what I could see he is a good player, so good luck to him.”Man of the match: Nikica Jelavic (West Ham)

Arsenal are mentally focused to push on after Cup win, says Arsène Wenger
~~AUTHOR~~
Barney Ronay
~CONTENTS~
English football is nothing if not adaptable. For so long the third round of the FA Cup has been synonymous with mud-caked, sinew-straining thrust in pursuit of victory or bust. Not so much at the Emirates Stadium on Saturday afternoon, where the dominant theme of Arsenal’s room-temperature, occasionally rousing defeat of Sunderland was a sense of contained commitment, of energy expended wisely and within limits.Sam Allardyce was happy with his team’s efforts. His greater concern was with switching thoughts immediately from a Cup exit at the hands of the holders to the more pressing business of Wednesday’s “nine-pointer” against Swansea in south Wales. For Sunderland it is the second stage in the 1,800-mile, eight-day, three-match away trip that will go a long way towards deciding how they approach the slog of February and the spring.Sam Allardyce ready to rebuild Sunderland around Jermain Defoe Read moreIf Arsène Wenger could afford to luxuriate in the glow of a 13th straight FA Cup win and another step closer to the wretchedly named “three-peat” – a word by which Wenger looked reassuringly baffled in his press conference – his thoughts were also with Wednesday night and Arsenal’s own trip to Liverpool. Wenger said he learned nothing from Liverpool’s draw with Exeter on Friday night, but refused to condemn Jürgen Klopp for fielding a collection of reserves, citing Liverpool’s many injuries and a pressing run of games.“Don’t worry! Arsène is a very good doctor! They always heal when they play against us,” Wenger noted, clearly not expecting a similarly threadbare XI on Wednesday night. Like Liverpool, Arsenal face a battle into the spring on multiple fronts, something Wenger believes has its benefits.“It has positive impact and negative impact. Once you’re on a roll, you can rotate, if you have no injuries. Everybody is mentally focused to pull in the same direction. It’s easier to keep everybody on board because you have always the next competition, and everybody thinks ‘I have a chance to play’.”One man who had seemed likely to make a first appearance since September at the Emirates was David Ospina. Wenger said the goalkeeper’s absence was down to “a little tight groin”, although speculation that he may move in the current window is unlikely to be dampened as a result.Also possibly on the way out is Mathieu Debuchy. He has been left semi-redundant by the transformation of Héctor Bellerín, who was supremely mobile and effective again against Sunderland, into a right-back of genuine class. “The European Championship is in France, you know, it’s a bit difficult for him at the moment to live with that,” Wenger conceded. In a bumper time for Arsenal full-backs generally, Nacho Monreal is “not far” from signing a new contract.For Sunderland, the season is narrowed to a fine point, an attritional Premier League escapology act that begins with the whistlestop tour of south Wales and a return to London to face Spurs on Saturday.“I have got to be careful about spouting my mouth off here,” Allardyce said on the subject of fixture pile-up. “I have already upset a lot of people but it is only about how passionately I feel about it. I know what I am talking about and I know what the players are going through because I’m a front-liner. I look them in the eye every day and I can see all the injuries everybody is picking up year after year.“[The Swansea match] is definitely a nine-pointer for either team. The distance they can pull away from us if they win and the closer we can get to them if we win makes it just as big a game as the Aston Villa one was for us last week.”John O’Shea, who left the pitch with a tight calf, is the only new injury concern. Allardyce also confirmed that “somebody” would be signing for the club this week – possibly the former Hull City striker Dame N’Doye – but it was glimpses of craft from the £8m summer signing Jeremain Lens, who scored the opening goal at the Emirates, that will give Sunderland heart. “I was very impressed. Hopefully he’s got to grips with this level of football, which is hugely difficult in your first season in the Premier League,” Allardyce said.“He is one of the most expensive players we have bought in recent years. He has got to live up to that reputation and the ability and skills he showed today was very encouraging.”Man of the match Héctor Bellerín (Arsenal)

The Manchester City captain, Vincent Kompany, was on board a plane which veered off the runway at Norwich Airport on Saturday.Press Association Sport understands City’s injured captain had watched his side beat Norwich 3-0 in the FA Cup before boarding a charter plane to take him home. The plane suffered problems as it tried to take off but Kompany was unhurt.“The airport remained open to helicopter traffic. The Air Accident Investigation Branch has been informed, which is standard practice,” the airport said in a statement to the BBC.Phil Brockwell, of Centreline Air, told the Eastern Daily Press: “It was at a fairly low speed of its departure, at which point it veered off the runway, for reasons for which we have some guesses.”

Real Madrid’s Gareth Bale saddened by Benítez exit but basks in Zidane acclaim
~~AUTHOR~~
Sid Lowe
~CONTENTS~
Gareth Bale insisted he is happy at Real Madrid after scoring a hat-trick on Zinedine Zidane’s managerial debut at the Santiago Bernabéu – but admitted he was disappointed Rafael Benítez was sacked and that it is impossible to predict where his own future lies.Bale scored three goals in a 5-0 victory over Deportivo de La Coruña, leaving the pitch to a standing ovation from the Real Madrid fans and departing the stadium with the match ball under his arm, signed by his team-mates. It was his second hat-trick in four games and he has now scored 10 times in seven. No player in La Liga has provided as many assists this season.Real Madrid and Gareth Bale give Zinedine Zidane the perfect start Read moreThe sports daily AS called Bale “colossal”, while Marca went for “fabulous”, the veteran match reporter Santiago Segurola writing: “Bale produced his best game at Real Madrid, and as good as any of those [produced] by the great stars of this club.”Zidane said: “Gareth should be very happy with the way he has played; it is not easy to score three goals.” Asked what he wanted from Bale now, the Frenchman replied: “For him to carry on like this.”Bale said: “I had a very good relationship with Rafa. Obviously, it was a big disappointment to see him go but things like this happen in football: you’re professional and you get on with it, and carry on.” Asked directly if he was happy and planned to stay at the club, he responded: “I’m happy at the moment. Obviously, you can never predict what happens in the future but I’m enjoying my football at the moment, so I’ll keep going.”The Wales forward, who admitted that he did not know if Zidane’s signature was among those scribbled on the ball, insisted that he had not had a point to make to his new manager, despite having been unhappy at the sacking of Benítez on 4 January.That move came less than a fortnight after the club’s president, Florentino Pérez, had promised the manager’s job was safe. “Zidane will not replace Benítez,” Pérez had said; 13 days and only one game later, that was exactly what happened. The president was aware that Bale was one of the few players in the squad who wanted Benítez to continue and that he was concerned by the change. So, too, was the new manager.“I understand that he can be annoyed with the departure of Benítez because he was an important coach for him but he is going to have the same affection [from me] as with Rafa,” Zidane said. “He is important for the squad, fundamental for the team. He is phenomenal and what he has been doing recently is fantastic. I’m going to give him all my affection and support so that he plays well.”The message was not only for public consumption. “That [was] nice of him to say. We had a chat when he first came in,” Bale revealed. “No matter what, I’ll always give 100% on a football pitch and that’s what I did tonight.“I just want to keep playing my football. I don’t feel I need to make a statement to anyone. I know what I’m capable of and I just want to keep enjoying my football, and when I do that I play my best football.”Bale had been concerned that the change of manager would result in him returning to the wing. If that happens, he will consider where his future lies. All three goals came with him in a more central position as he produced arguably his best all-round display since joining the club for a world record transfer fee.“There have been comments in previous interviews and stuff [commenting on the fact that] I’ve been stuck on the right, and I didn’t have that freedom but now on the right I’m able to come in and float around a bit as well. Obviously, my main position would be on the right. I’m enjoying my football, I’m enjoying my position at the moment and hopefully I continue to do so.“My best position is being able to roam around the front and try and find weaknesses in the defence, I suppose. Everybody knows where I like to play and what I like to do on the pitch, and hopefully I can keep doing it.”After Madrid had produced an improved display in an atmosphere that had changed entirely, the midfielder Luka Modric said: “We feel sorry for Rafa Benítez but you only have to see our performances; the change has been good for us.”Bale insisted, however: “I don’t think there was too much difference, to be honest. We’ve been working hard of late and maybe we didn’t have a bit of luck before but I think we’re all working the same amount on the football pitch. We’re all giving 100% and the most important thing is we win games and win titles.”That is something Bale believes they can still do, despite trailing both Barcelona and Atlético Madrid at the top of the table. “I think this time last year we were clear and we hadn’t lost in 22 games or something,” he said. “We know what can happen in the league, we know we have to keep fighting all the way; we’ll keep doing that until the last whistle.”• This article was amended on 13 January 2016. An earlier version referred to Gareth Bale as the Wales captain. This has been corrected to say Wales forward. Ashley Williams is the Wales captain.

Lionel Messi set for Ballon d’Or but Neymar threatens the old duopoly
~~AUTHOR~~
Sid Lowe
~CONTENTS~
When Michael Owen won the Ballon d’Or in 2001, becoming the first and still the only Englishman to win European football’s player of the year award since Kevin Keegan, his manager had to take him aside and impress upon him just how important this was. “Gérard Houllier was surprised when he first told me,” Owen admitted. “I think he was a bit put out by me not punching the air and going hysterical. He was saying: ‘Do you realise what this means?’”Had Owen seen what was going on in Spain, he would have done: in Madrid they were loudly decrying the injustice of it all, the cheek of this Englishman who had taken what was “rightfully” Raúl’s. They still do, in fact. Here it was an obsession, front page almost daily. “It’s a massive thing but it’s not big in England,” Owen said. “In England, it gets a little column on the back page telling you who has won it, if you’re lucky.”Fifteen years on, things have changed. There are still around 900 words to go in this column, for a start. Presented by James Nesbitt, Monday night’s gala – at which there will also be a presidential award but no president – will be shown live by Sky and Eurosport. Some people might even watch it; they’ll certainly argue over it. It is hard to imagine an English winner these days only admitting some time after the event, as Owen did: “Since then, I’ve realised what it means. It’s one of the best individual awards.” Since then? One of them?It is hard to imagine an English winner at all, of course, and this still feels like a Spanish thing – even if, like La Liga, it attracts greater attention than ever before. Football interest has become internationalised and the Champions League has made Europeans of the English, even if the EU has not. For the past six years the winner has been someone playing in Spain. This year’s winner will be a player from La Liga, too: Leo Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo orNeymar.The truth is that “Spain” is probably too broad a category here. Since 1997 only two winners of the Ballon d’Or – Pavel Nedved and Andriy Shevchenko – have not either been playing in Spain or ended up playing there. In every case, their club was Real Madrid or Barcelona. And over the past seven years, the category could be reduced again. Leo Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo have finished first and second every year for four years and in six of the past seven years, albeit in 2008 Ronaldo was still at Manchester United.Ronaldo in 2008, followed by Messi for the next four years, then Ronaldo again in 2013 and 2014: these men have dominated an era like none before, the Madrid-Barça rivalry expressed through its two greatest players, with the golden ball acting as some kind of ultimate arbiter. Not that it is an unchallenged one; complaints and conspiracy theories still abound.If there are echoes of Juanma Lillo’s comment about the garnish eating the steak – brilliant performances in decisive games and trophies won presented as evidence towards a Ballon d’Or candidacy as much as an end in themselves, and players elevated over teams – it is still an extraordinary run from two players to be celebrated, if only people could stop getting so angry about them.There is a chance that on Monday the run will be broken, though. Perhaps even for good. This year it seemed possible that the three candidates might not just come from the same country but, like in 2010, from the same club. That year, Spain’s World Cup win brought Andrés Iniesta and Xavi to the podium alongside Messi; this year, Barcelona’s treble might have also elevated Neymar and Luis Suárez – all the more so if the award is judged on 2015, the calendar year, not just the last season.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Lionel Messi and Neymar, alongside Luis Suárez who did not make the shortlist, inspired a dominant year for Barcelona. Photograph: Lluis Gene/AFP/Getty ImagesBetween them, Messi, Neymar and Suárez won it all and scored 180 goals in 2015, more than any forward line has ever scored and the spread was remarkably even, the contributions consistent from all three men in a historic 12 months.In the end, Suárez did not make it. Rarely can so strong a candidate have been left out, a treble winner with a goal in the European Cup final, five goals in two games to take Barcelona to the Club World Cup, currently top scorer in La Liga. But, unlike in the Uefa award where he made the top three, Ronaldo and Neymar are included ahead of him. It is no terrible injustice, just a measure of how good the field is.There may be an element of inertia there, the one-two of this era an automatic choice, a sense that voting for Ronaldo is just what you do; that the only doubt in any world player list is, by definition, the third man – and that there the choice is Suárez or Neymar but not both. There will be a recognition that it is hardly Ronaldo’s fault that his team has won nothing. If 2015 has been difficult, the fact that it is possible to talk of “decline” for a player who scored more than 50 goals for a fifth consecutive year shows how absurdly high he sets the bar. His “decline” is pretty much every other player’s dream.Football quiz: Ballon d'Or winners Read moreEven after a campaign that ended empty-handed it is natural that most believe that the man who won the last two awards still stands above all except Messi, but that assumption perhaps faces its firmest challenge for years in Zurich and the next question may be if it is simply a one-off. Neymar makes a strong case – and at 23, he will make more. Ronaldo turns 31 next month, has fought pain in his knee, and questions about his future will not go away, so it is natural that some ask if this year may be the last time that he and Messi stand one and two, the end of a certainty that’s marked almost a decade.If Ronaldo was to finish outside the top two, it would be the first time in five years. More likely is that he will finish second and, as ever, will be far from satisfied with that – that the ambition that defines him will remain undimmed, determined to return and regain the trophy he made his own for the last two years, overthrowing Messi again, as he did when he ended the Argentinian’s unique four-year run. But that there is even a doubt is significant. For second place, that is. When it comes to first, occupied by Ronaldo two years running, the only doubt is what suit Messi will wear.

Shrewsbury’s Andy Mangan marks return by knocking Cardiff out of Cup
~CONTENTS~
The Shrewsbury Town manager, Micky Mellon, paid tribute to the returning Andy Mangan after the striker’s winner dumped Cardiff City of the Championship out of the FA Cup.Mangan signed for a second spell with Shrewsbury last week and his 62nd-minute header put the League One club into the fourth-round draw. The 29-year-old left Shrewsbury in the summer, with the club unable to afford to keep him, but made the switch back from Tranmere Rovers to link up with Mellon once again.Tottenham’s Harry Kane spot-on to deny Leicester and Shinji Okazaki Read moreIt sparked a turn in fortunes for Mellon’s side, who lost 7-1 at Chesterfield on 2 January, Shrewsbury’s worst result since 1962.Mellon said: “More so than getting through to the fourth round, we owed a lot of people a lot of things after the performance last Saturday. We showed a huge amount of character to come to a club like Cardiff and get a result. I’ve signed Andy three times, so you can say I’m pretty keen on him. He’s a great talent and a great player and someone who should have played a lot more games at a higher level.“It was tough to let him go in the summer. This club’s had some tough times and this is the fourth time I have had to rebuild the team. It’s a bit ridiculous and frustrating at the same time but hopefully we can get settled now and move forward. We have to try and build on this result and hit the standards we have set.”Mangan had almost put the visitors in front inside a minute but his shot was blocked by Bruno Manga. Sammy Ameobi hit the post for the home side in the first half but they wasted several good chances.Mangan’s winner came just after the hour mark when he rose to meet Scott Vernon’s ball from the left. The Cardiff defender Manga could have earned a replay in injury time but he sent a free header wide of the post from Peter Whittingham’s corner.The Cardiff manager, Russell Slade, said: “I’m disappointed. There was enough ammunition out there to get the desired result. Sometimes you lose that little bit of continuity but statistically it’s 64% possession and 27 shots. We had chances to score but we didn’t take those opportunities unfortunately.“It was an opportunity for those players to impress – the ones who haven’t had so much football recently. They’ll feel let down themselves – that’s the important thing. Have they done themselves justice when they’ve been given the opportunity by the manager?“We’re all accountable. As manager, I’m accountable but players are also accountable for their own performance out on the pitch. Even though they’ve not had the benefit of playing together as a unit or as an XI for any length of time, you’re still looking for a better performance than that.”

A-League talking points: suspense, surprise and a near-perfect script
~~AUTHOR~~
Jonathan Howcroft
~CONTENTS~
Round 14 was the most compelling of this season so far. Like a five-chapter novella it twisted and turned throughout the weekend, bristling with energy and the unexpected.The five matches built to different crescendos but all shared one trait vital to compelling sport. No game was out of reach of either protagonist until the final stages. At one extreme there was Melbourne Victory’s last minute equaliser. At the other Sydney FC finally shutting down Newcastle Jets with just 10 minutes still to play. Smack bang in the sweet spot there was Melbourne City’s thrilling victory over Western Sydney Wanderers.Melbourne Victory snatch draw from jaws of loss to Central Coast Mariners Read moreThe round conforms to a theory proposed by a team of economists from the University of Chicago. In a journal article titled Suspense and Surprise they attempt to explain the optimum conditions for compelling drama. The argument follows that drama is most impactful when the onlooker cannot confidently predict what’s going to happen next (suspense), and is then genuinely surprised as the plot is revealed.The opening match of the round was a surprise party. It was surprising to see Harry Ascroft head the opener, jolting to witness Josh Bingham double the Central Coast Mariners’ lead, and stupefying to watch Mitch Austin wheel away in celebration as the Simonds Stadium scoreboard read 3-0 before half-time.Thereafter it was a clinic in suspense. Champion sides like Victory do not baulk at a challenge and from Besart Berisha’s penalty the comeback had a sense of inevitability about it. Still, the chances that went begging after Archie Thompson made it 3-2 only heightened the tension around the unfamiliar venue and piqued the outpouring of emotion when Berisha finally equalised to spare the premiers’ blushes.The authors of Suspense and Surprise, Jeffrey Ely, Alexander Frankel, and Emir Kamenica, address sporting narratives in their paper. Specifically, what a sport optimised for dramatic effect would look like.Conveniently, they are advocates for football as a starting point. This is due to the comparatively high value and the relative rarity of a goal forcing supporters into a state of near permanent suspense. It is impossible to take your eyes off a close game for fear of missing something critical. The improvement suggested for heightened dramatic effect is the implementation of a “next goal wins” endpoint so that all matches are at stake until the final whistle, in a permanent mode of attack versus defence.Which brings us neatly to Melbourne City’s duel with Western Sydney Wanderers.Melbourne City end Western Sydney Wanderers' lengthy unbeaten streak Read moreCity raced into a two goal lead with such brio it was hard to imagine they were held scoreless by the Wanderers just eight rounds previously. A rare Thomas Sørensen error opened the door for a Wanderers comeback, and the luckless Aaron Hughes brought parity to the occasion with half-an-hour remaining.Thereafter it was next goal wins, and the matchwinner would surely come from a Wanderers boot. Tony Popovic’s outfit seemed an irresistible force, dominating possession, peppering Sørensen’s goal and finding space at will behind the City defence. Unfortunately for the visitors the last time they made the net bulge the referee intervened decisively.In the 80th minute a quickly-taken Dimas free-kick was finished with aplomb by Mark Bridge. The set-piece appeared to be struck with the referee’s consent but before the travelling supporters had time to lock arms in a celebratory Poznan a second whistle pierced the Melbourne night, reprieving City.Jarred Gillett explained his actions afterwards, and deserves credit for doing so. However, his explanation reveals only that he incorrectly restarted play. The Wanderers have every right to feel harshly treated.“I originally called Patrick Kisnorbo out of position to manage the original situation,” Gillett told Fox Sports. “After doing so I restarted playing while the assistant referee was telling me not to restart because Kisnorbo wasn’t in position and therefore they were disadvantaged. The fair thing to do was to restart from the free-kick.”At the time it seemed not to matter as the Wanderers were surely destined to find a winner. Harry Novillo had other ideas.Suspense and Surprise illustrates how City’s victory was an example of prime dramatic plot development. The authors’ research led them to believe the optimum number of plot twists in a story is three. This game saw City sprint out of the blocks, the Wanderers slowly seize the ascendancy (twist one), the referee deny the by now expected outcome (twist two) before Novillo finally drills home the unanticipated resolution (twist three).Sydney FC beat Newcastle Jets as Ali Abbas scores on comeback from injury Read moreOn the subject of scriptwriting, Saturday’s earlier match lacked the ebbs and flows of what was to follow but Sydney FC’s routine 2-0 victory over the worryingly impotent Jets contained one of the season’s most heartwarming storylines. Ali Abbas had not played an A-League match for 405 days since injuring his knee but bounded from the substitutes’ bench to drill home the clincher and trigger emotional scenes at ANZ Stadium. “It couldn’t have been scripted better,” Graham Arnold said afterwards.Ordinarily a match featuring Adelaide United’s return to freescoring form, an away win in Perth, and a controversial first half red card, would combine for a fixture deserving of top billing. Not this week. United are a team rapidly on the rise though and their first appearance in the top six this season is well deserved.Alex Grant’s dismissal will generate the most column inches but the legacy of this match may well prove to be Adelaide’s first half equaliser. All season Guillermo Amor’s side have looked competent in possession but directionless up front. On 27 minutes everything clicked and some sumptuous passing and movement on the edge of the Glory box resulted in Sergio Cirio beating Ante Covic. This goal was peak Adelaide and a warning to the rest of the competition that despite a slow start to the campaign there remains abundant quality in the United camp.Brisbane Roar’s trip to Wellington Phoenix may have lacked the goals of other matches in the round but it contained its fair share of drama nonetheless. Not least another pivotal refereeing decision that saw a Roar penalty award reversed during a confusing first half incident. Both teams had good chances to win at the death but the stalemate prevailed. The point was enough to send Brisbane clear at the top of the ladder.

Mark Sampson‘s tactics at World Cup propel him to Ballon d’Or awards
~~AUTHOR~~
Louise Taylor
~CONTENTS~
It is late June in Ottawa and, beneath a searing sun, England have fallen a goal behind against Norway. The temperature down on the pitch has hit 40C but Mark Sampson feels an all too familiar chill. “I’m sure the whole nation was thinking: ‘Here we go again,’” says the Lionesses’ coach.Norway 1-2 England | Women’s World Cup round-of-16 match report Read moreHe is speaking from Zurich where the thermometer hovers just above freezing point and, having only just arrived straight from a holiday in the Cayman Islands with his girlfriend, Sampson really is shivering.Seven months have passed since England played that Women’s World Cup last 16 game in the Canadian capital but their eventual win against Norway represents a big reason why he is in Switzerland, ready to rub shoulders with Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo et al at the Ballon d’Or awards on Monday night.The Lionessess ended up finishing third at Canada 2015, with Sampson’s clever tactics and inspired use of substitutes ensuring he is now competing with Jill Ellis of the United States and Japan’s Norio Sasaki for Fifa’s Women’s coach of the year award. Should Sampson win, the Welshman would enjoy an extremely rare moment of British Ballon d’Or success.Back in Ottawa, though, he was under severe pressure. Unless he could somehow turn things round, his team were destined to bow out having maintained an unenviable record of never having won a knockout game at a major tournament. The Football Association had invested a lot of money in the women’s squad and Sampson knew uncomfortable questions would be asked.The time had come to utilise the tactical acumen that helped camouflage the reality that, in Karen Carney, England possessed only one player in the world’s top 40. With Katie Chapman shifted deeper in midfield, he scrapped his original patient, containment plan and introduced the pace and dynamism of Jill Scott and Jodie Taylor from the bench.Steph Houghton, the captain, headed an equaliser and then, cued up by Scott and Taylor, Lucy Bronze shot a sensational winner. England proceeded to overcome Canada in a quarter-final played in front of a fiercely partisan 54,000-strong crowd at Vancouver’s packed BC Place Stadium before narrowly bowing out to Japan at the semi-final stage. No matter; the third place play-off featured the Lionesses beating Germany for the first time in more than three decades. Across the Atlantic, hearts and minds were won as an entire country finally became captivated by the women’s game.England 2-1 Canada | Women's World Cup quarter-final match report Read more“Norway was a real breakthrough moment in a breakthrough year,” says Sampson, now 33. “Norway had so much quality they really could have won the World Cup. But our players showed we had the mentality to fight back.”His man management helped forge an extraordinary team spirit and he is anxious to emphasise that he is “representing the group, the players, my assistant Marieanne Spacey, my staff” in Zurich but it is also very much a personal achievement.For someone who, less than six years ago, was coaching Taffs Well, a Welsh non-league men’s team, and would later take charge of Bristol Academy in the women’s super league, to be in such exalted company feels understandably “surreal”.Sampson, a once undistinguished non-league defender, hopes his presence will also help inspire and “encourage” other British coaches. Managers from the United Kindgom are usually conspicious by their absence at the Ballon d’Or but, coincidentally Ellis – who US side thrashed Sasaki’s Japan in the final, was born in Portsmouth. “Jill’s done great, she’s great,” enthuses a man determined to relish the moment. “We’ve just seen Kaká. I’m going to enjoy this. It’s something I may never experience again.”There seems little danger of him getting carried away. “As my dad keeps reminding me: ‘You’re only as good as your last game,’ and there’s lot of challenges ahead,” says Sampson. “But this a very nice bonus … ”

Tottenham’s Harry Kane spot-on to deny Leicester and Shinji Okazaki
~~AUTHOR~~
Simon Burnton
~CONTENTS~
A game that Tottenham Hotspur started at a canter was eventually rescued at the last when Harry Kane’s 89th-minute penalty earned an increasingly ragged Spurs side another chance against an often uninspired but always obdurate Leicester City.In many ways this tie should be judged not in isolation but as the first of what will now be a triple-header between two teams who before this encounter had played each other four times in a decade and will now meet three times in 10 days, with a Premier League match here on Wednesday followed by a replay at the King Power Stadium on Tuesday next week.Two very different teams will contest the second match but this was a lively opening act and a reasonable indicator of what may be to come. “Of course every match is different but more or less they will play the same way with other players and we’ll play more or less the same way with other players,” said Claudio Ranieri, looking ahead to Wednesday.Tottenham Hotspur v Leicester City: FA Cup third round – as it happened Read moreThis was often frustrating but never less than intriguing, a game of swinging fortunes in which a Leicester side that were, as promised, largely unfamiliar – they made eight changes to their starting XI, one more than Spurs – initially seemed likely to be outplayed but were ultimately unfortunate to be denied victory.In the 88th minute Danny Rose cut in from the left, thought better of it and jinked outside again. As he did so the ball flicked off Nathan Dyer’s boot and into the air, hitting the Leicester winger’s arm on its way back down. As he spun to track Rose’s run Dyer seemed to have little idea of the ball’s whereabouts and Leicester’s opinion of Robert Madley’s decision was obvious from their furious reaction to it.“It’s not important what me or my players say, it’s the referee who’s the boss,” said Ranieri. “Of course we’re frustrated because our second half was very good, very calm, and we defended very well. But it’s OK, we’ll play another match and I’m so glad to give another chance to my eight players.”The resulting goal was Kane’s 50th for Tottenham, scored in his 104th appearance. “I’m happy for him because the goal he scored helped us to stay alive in the FA Cup,” said Mauricio Pochettino. “The first half we played very well, scored, made chances but the second half was difficult. We are happy and very pleased because in the end it’s important for us to stay alive in the competition.”With the stars of both teams’ seasons not initially involved – Jamie Vardy, recovering from a groin operation, could return on Wednesday, while Riyad Mahrez, Dele Alli and Kane started on the bench – Tottenham had the stronger XI, took an early lead and dominated the first half. Within eight minutes they were ahead and Josh Onomah, 18-year-old veteran of nine minutes’ league action, claimed a starring role in the goal.Nominally stationed on the right of a strikerless attacking trident, Onomah frequently drifted to the left and it was here that he picked up the ball and drove forward. His run was eventually halted but Spurs swiftly won the ball back and returned it to him, and his first-time flick released Nacer Chadli. The Belgian’s low, hard cross was pushed away by Kasper Schmeichel and Christian Eriksen sidefooted the loose ball into the far corner.A second goal, however, would not come. First Schmeichel beat away Eriksen’s dipping free-kick and then in the 18th minute Chadli flicked the ball to Son Heung-min, received a first-time return pass and then once again found the South Korean, who nutmegged Marcin Wasilewski and looked set to crown the game’s finest move until Richie De Laet’s perfectly timed intervention.A minute later Leicester were level, the equaliser not so much against the run of play as an affront to it. Demarai Gray, who made a promising debut following his £3.7m move from Birmingham, swung in a corner and the previously creaky – and already cautioned – Wasilewski escaped Toby Alderweireld and headed past Michel Vorm. Son, Chadli and Eric Dier saw shots from outside the area saved with some ease before half-time, with Leicester again in retreat, yet within three minutes of the restart the visitors were ahead.Again the goal came from a Gray corner, though not quite so directly. This time his cross was initially cleared but, as Spurs pushed out down the right, Leicester regained possession and exploited the space behind them. Andy King passed to Shinji Okazaki, just on as a substitute, who ran into the area, beat Alderweireld with a dip of a shoulder and blasted a shot that bounced back to him off Vorm, the rebound prodded into the net off the inside of the near post.Tottenham’s search for an equaliser rarely brought them within 20 yards of a well-protected Leicester goal. Chadli headed over from Son’s volleyed cross and saw a shot deflected tamely to Schmeichel after bulldozing his way into the box while De Laet again stole the ball off Son’s toe but, despite the arrival off the bench of Kane and Alli, Spurs offered little more than hopeful long-range shots and disappointing Eriksen set pieces. Hope seemed to be ebbing away, and time certainly was, when Rose – and the referee – intervened.Man of the match Richie De Laet (Leicester City)

Bournemouth complete £9m record signing of Wolves striker Benik Afobe

~CONTENTS~
Bournemouth have completed the signing of the Wolves striker Benik Afobe for a club record fee of £9m.The 22-year-old has signed a four-and-a-half-year contract and will go straight into the squad to face West Ham on Tuesday, providing the club receive clearance from the Football Association in time.Glenn Murray rescues Bournemouth with late Cup winner at Birmingham City Read moreAfobe underwent his medical at the Vitality Stadium on Sunday morning after the striker held talks with the Bournemouth manager, Eddie Howe, on Friday.Afobe becomes Bournemouth’s second signing of the transfer window after the club signed the Roma forward Juan Iturbe on a loan deal until the end of the season on 1 January.Iturbe and Afobe will need to be fully registered by midday on Monday to be eligible for Tuesday’s match.Afobe scored 23 goals in 48 appearances for Wolves, after leaving his boyhood club Arsenal, where he failed to make a first-team appearance.Bournemouth’s previous record outlay was the £8m on the former Ipswich defender Tyrone Mings, who was cruelly ruled out for the season on his debut at home to Leicester in September.“It happened to me last season when I signed for Wolves in January and there was just two or three days’ training sessions, and then there was a game and I was lucky enough to score on my debut,” Afobe told the club website.“I think it’s better sometimes. If you sign in pre-season, you still have six weeks until the league season starts but now I know that I’m ready to play on Tuesday.“I’m looking forward to it and I’m definitely ready because I haven’t missed a game this season. I feel fresh, I feel strong, I feel physically fine and I’m mentally strong as well, so I’m ready to go.”The Championship side Wolves agreed a deal to sell their top scorer, who has 10 goals this season, before Saturday’s defeat at Upton Park.The striker signed a three-and-half-year deal at Molineux last January after a fruitful loan spell with MK Dons and his form since has seen him attract Premier League interest, notably from Norwich City.“We feel this is a very good deal for the long-term future of the club,” said Howe. “We are trying to look to the future and have signed a player who we believe will get better with us and, hopefully, stay here for many years.“You could go through our squad and pick 80 per cent of players who hadn’t done it until they had been with us. You need to give players an opportunity and a chance to prove they can or can’t do it.“We could easily go the other route and sign players who have done it but are potentially past their best. But I don’t think that is the right way for this club to go.”The former Arsenal striker will bolster the attacking options available to Howe who had until recently relied on Joshua King, who is currently sidelined with a niggling hamstring injury, to fill the void left by Callum Wilson, who picked up an anterior cruciate knee injury against Stoke City in late September.“I felt we needed a striker. Callum we lost and that was a huge blow to us and we have lost Josh King with hamstring problems. It has left us very light and we need firepower. We need players who can come in and do the job,” Howe said after Bournemouth’s 2-1 FA Cup win at Birmingham.

Yeovil earn replay after Shaun Jeffers’ stoppage-time equaliser against Carlisle
~CONTENTS~
The Yeovil Town manager, Darren Way, praised his side’s “fantastic performance” after they snatched a late equaliser against a Carlisle side who twice surrendered the lead in the FA Cup third round tie at Blackpool’s Bloomfield Road. Shaun Jeffers slotted in Yeovil’s second goal in added time to secure a replay against a Cumbrian side still playing home matches in exile after last month’s flooding.Way said: “It was a great finish. Carlisle slowed the game down and hit direct balls, making it difficult to play against, but I was pleased with the way the boys fought back.“We showed bouncebackability and we are starting to get belief. It’s nice to be in the draw, but we know there is a lot of hard work to be done. I thought the lads deserved the draw and I want to create positivity about the place. So far it’s happened.”Way was wary of focusing too much on the next round, with a third-round replay against their fellow League Two side still to negotiate in Somerset.He said: “It’s a case of enjoying the moment. I’m not focusing too much on who we might get – but it’s good that there could be the opportunity to play against a big team.”Way was disappointed his side conceded the first goal from a set piece, the Carlisle captain, Danny Grainger, thumping a free-kick around the defensive wall from 20 yards. Way said: “Too many times we’ve seen a free-kick and the ball flies into the roof of the net.”The former Carlisle striker François Zoko headed Yeovil level for the first time after the break and Way said: “He rose well and it was something special for him against his old club.”Carlisle’s manager, Keith Curle, said after the match at Bloomfield Road that his players were feeling frustrated. “The pitch made it difficult for us to play the way we wanted to play, but we took the lead twice and should have been able to see the game out.“There is an air of disappointment because we knew we had done enough to win the game – and yet ultimately we didn’t. The Yeovil goals were pretty basic. We showed a bit of naivety but we have a replay to look forward to and we are still in the hat. Yes, we’re disappointed, but it’s a challenge we have to face.”Carlisle’s second goal came from a header by the central defender Mark Ellis, who was celebrating signing a new two-and-a-half-year contract. Yeovil’s goal also had an incredible double escape in the 56th minute when Grainger shot against the underside of the crossbar and Charlie Wyke could only head the rebound against a post from inside the six-yard box.Curle said: “If I was a gambling man I would have put money on him [Ellis] scoring today. By the end of the season I think he could have six or seven goals.”The 52-year-old was also keen to praise the “phenomenal support” of 3,000 travelling Carlisle fans. He added: “The surface didn’t allow us to play as they would have expected, but it was a typical cup tie.”Blackburn Rovers step in to host Carlisle United game after floods Read more

Chelsea see off Scunthorpe United with Ruben Loftus-Cheek’s first goal
~~AUTHOR~~
David Hytner
~CONTENTS~
Roman Abramovich was all smiles from his lofty perch at Stamford Bridge. The Chelsea owner has long wanted to see some sort of return from the club’s Academy in which he has invested heavily and here, at last, was something to cheer.Chelsea were 1-0 up against a game Scunthorpe United team but they were not safe and the League One minnows had complained bitterly at the non-award of a penalty on 53 minutes for a trip by Ramires on Kevin van Veen.Football: Behind the scenes at the Chelsea Academy Read moreEnter Ruben Loftus-Cheek. The 19-year-old midfielder, the only recent Stamford Bridge youth product in Guus Hiddink’s match-day squad, had come on as a half-time substitute. And in the 68th minute he made his mark to make sure Chelsea would be in the draw for the FA Cup fourth round.His first goal in professional football was a poacher’s finish, guided home low with his left foot following César Azpilicueta’s cut-back, after decent Chelsea approach work, and how Abramovich enjoyed it. It remains a source of frustration inside the club’s Academy that the pathway to the first team appears as little more than a mirage and, as such, Loftus-Cheek carries great responsibility. He handled it here.Scunthorpe, too, handled the occasion. After being overrun for the first quarter of the game, having shown Chelsea too much respect, they found a way into the tie on the back of their whole-hearted commitment. And if the referee, Craig Pawson, had seen Ramires’s challenge on Van Veen in another way, they might have fashioned a different ending.Ramires had tracked the Scunthorpe attacker to the very edge of the Chelsea area and he clipped his standing foot. Down went Van Veen and he appeared to make the most of it, but there was contact. Pawson was unmoved. Scunthorpe were incensed. “It was a nailed-on penalty,” Mark Robins, the Scunthorpe manager, said.Chelsea had been dumped out of this competition at this venue by League One opposition last season – Bradford City’s 4-2 win left its scars – but at full-time they could play the role of the magnanimous big brother. John Terry, the non-playing Chelsea captain, invited the Scunthorpe players into the home dressing room for the exchange of both shirts and compliments.“We had a good celebration in our locker room,” Hiddink said. “They made us shiver during the game. It was their final, a big day for them and it was for us, too, because we wanted to go into the next round.”Hiddink won the FA Cup during his previous caretaker spell at Chelsea in 2009 and the competition seems like the club’s best chance of silverware this time . They made a strong start here, with Diego Costa giving them the lead, but they did not have it all their own way despite Hiddink fielding a strong starting XI.Robins had strung five across midfield and initially his team struggled to escape their half. But they stabilised after the first quarter of the game and even after Loftus-Cheek’s goal they refused to lie down.Van Veen banged a free-kick just past the near post, Neal Bishop saw a shot blocked by Willian and, when Robins’ team had recycled the play, the right-back Jordan Clarke exploded a drive from the corner of the area that Asmir Begovic turned on to the woodwork. With the last kick of the tie Bishop stabbed a shot wide.Costa’s eighth goal of the season – and his fourth in three games since José Mourinho’s sacking – came when he deftly volleyed home from Branislav Ivanovic’s cross. Luke Daniels, the Scunthorpe goalkeeper, saved from Cesc Fàbregas and Pedro before the midway point of the first half. Oscar also curled narrowly wide.Scunthorpe showed plenty of fight, not least Bishop and the captain, Stephen Dawson. Bishop kicked Fàbregas from behind on the half-hour and when the Chelsea man turned round to remonstrate, the Scunthorpe midfielder pushed him in the chest. Bishop had another shoving match in the second half with Costa.Scunthorpe enjoyed a fistful of what-if moments before the interval. Dawson had a ferocious shot repelled by Cahill’s head – “Gary is very British,” Hiddink said – while Luke Williams, the lone striker, quickened the pulses of the travelling supporters.He worked Begovic from outside the area and, when he capitalised on a Cahill error to streak away into the area, Kurt Zouma came across to make a full-blooded slide challenge. Van Veen’s dangerous cross in the 45th minute also had just too much on it for Bishop.Loftus-Cheek, such an imposing physical presence, played as the No10 in place of Oscar – who had a slight toe injury – and he was guilty of catching Bishop with a lunge shortly after he came on.But it was another clumsy challenge that made for one of the loudest talking points.With each replay Scunthorpe fans were more and more convinced that Pawson ought to have penalised Ramires. Bishop and Dawson continued to mix it in midfield but it was Loftus-Cheek who put the tie beyond them and their team.Man of the match Diego Costa (Chelsea)

Sassuolo shock Serie A leaders Inter with last gasp penalty win
~CONTENTS~
Domenico Berardi converted a penalty in the fifth minute of injury time on Sunday to give Sassuolo a shock 1-0 win at the Serie A leaders, Internazionale, who dominated the match but were repeatedly foiled by the visitors’ goalkeeper, Andrea Consigli.Berardi sent the Inter goalkeeper, Samir Handanovic, the wrong way to complete an extraordinary win for Sassuolo, who were beaten 7-0 in the same fixture last season, as Inter’s coach Roberto Mancini watched in disbelief.The penalty was awarded after the Inter defender Jeisson Murillo mistimed a header, then his team-mate Miranda clumsily bundled over Grégoire Defrel as the hosts made a pig’s ear of dealing with a seemingly innocuous Sassuolo attack.Inter missed a flurry of early chances and when Adem Ljajic finally managed to get a curling effort on target, just before half-time, his effort was brilliantly tipped away by Consigli.Consigli again denied the Serb after the break, then did well to parry a low drive from Geoffrey Kondogbia as he kept sixth-placed Sassuolo in the game.In an end-to-end match, the Inter forward Rodrigo Palacio had a shot cleared off the line while, at the other end, Handanovic made a superb reflex save at close range to stop an acrobatic volley from Antonio Floro Flores.Consigli again denied Ljajic and turned away a curling effort from the substitute Stevan Jovetic before Berardi struck for Sassuolo.Inter have 39 points from 19 games, one ahead of Napoli, who play at Frosinone later on Sunday, and three clear of Juventus, who travel to Sampdoria.

Oxford United’s Kemar Roofe dumps Swansea City out of FA Cup with double
~~AUTHOR~~
Paul Doyle
~CONTENTS~
Oxford United see Swansea City as mentors when it comes to club development but the League Two team taught their Premier League idols a lesson here, deservedly emerging triumphant from a rollicking FA Cup tie.Michael Appleton’s team outfought and outplayed their illustrious guests, the upset all the more admirable because they had to come from behind to pull it off. Jefferson Montero put the visitors in front with an exquisite early goal, an effort that proved that, despite Alan Curtis refusing to be shamed by Sam Allardyce into naming his strongest available team – he omitted several key players to preserve them for Wednesday’s Premier League visit of Sunderland – Swansea still boast rich pedigree. So it was immensely admirable from an Oxford viewpoint – and “hugely disappointing” from Curtis’s – to see Liam Sercombe equalise from the penalty spot before Kemar Roofe secured victory with two excellent goals. Bafétimbi Gomis’s subsequent reply was not enough to save Swansea.“It is one thing to beat a Premier League team but more important was the way we did it,” said a proud Appleton, who could draw further satisfaction from hearing Curtis admit: “We knew Oxford were a good footballing team and we felt that might suit us but they had more energy than us, they passed the ball better and we did not show anything like what we think we are capable of. Our players couldn’t cope with them.”Oxford United 3-2 Swansea City: FA Cup third round – as it happened Read moreIt seemed nonsensical that these teams are separated by 54 places in the league pyramid, which is exactly the impression that Oxford players had sought to create, several of them starting on a mission to prove that they should never have been discarded by clubs higher up. George Baldock and John Lundstram were accomplished but Roofe stole the show by taking both his goals expertly.That brought his tally for the season to 15 and raised questions as to why he never made a senior appearance during four years at West Bromwich Albion, who instead loaned him out to a succession of clubs, including one in Iceland, before he joined Oxford in the summer. “I just never got the chance at West Brom,” said the 23-year-old. “I believe I should have had that chance; I did all I could. Jamie Vardy started lower and he got the scoring record in the Premier League. It can be done given the time and chance.”For all that, Swansea made the brighter start here. Montero squandered an opportunity to seize the lead in the seventh minute, blasting over from 16 yards after a pull-back from Marvin Emnes. Jonjo Shelvey, meanwhile, repeatedly tried to burst the net from way out, the ball whizzing off target by varying degrees each time.Oxford soon found their bearings and began to give better than they got, displaying the sort of crisp passing and movement more usually associated with the Welsh team. Baldock, the right-back who has excelled this season while on loan from MK Dons, was the first to threaten for the home team, racing down the flank and crossing for Roofe, whose header flew just over the bar. Oxford then went close to opening the scoring, as Kristoffer Nordfeldt was forced to tip over a header by Ryan Taylor after an incisive move by Appleton’s team. Swansea’s goal in the 23rd minute came slightly against the run of play but there was no denying its class. Montero pinged a pass to Emnes on the edge of the area and then received a return that eliminated two defenders, leaving the Ecuadorian with only the advancing Sam Slocombe to beat, which he duly did with a delicious back-heeled finish.Swansea could have killed the tie five minutes later but Emnes miscontrolled when put through by Matty Grimes. Oxford soon made the most of that reprieve. Tidily and dynamically they regained the initiative. Swansea began to look slovenly. “Some of our players did not do themselves any favours,” conceded Curtis. Swansea could not hold out until half-time, succumbing to intense Oxford pressure just before the break. After Nordfeldt pushed away a shot by Jake Wright, Alex MacDonald retrieved it and tried to dash into a shooting position, only to go down under a challenge by Kyle Bartley. Sercombe drove in the penalty. “He’s a cool customer,” said Appleton.Oxford started the second half like a side sensing that glory was within their grasp. Some Swansea players did not seem terribly bothered. Within four minutes of the resumption Oxford were in front thanks to a wonderful goal by Roofe. After collecting a long pass and cutting in from the left, he placed a splendid curling shot into the far corner from 20 yards.Ten minutes later Roofe topped that. As Swansea fought limply to save face, Roofe helped clear a corner, joined in a rapid counterattack and raced on to a pass from Chris Maguire. Nordfeldt rushed out to confront him but could not get a firm enough touch on his shot to stop it bouncing into the net.Gomis pulled a goal back for the Premier League side with a calm finish in the 66th minute. “We didn’t even look anything like a team until after we went 3-1 down,” lamented Curtis. But Oxford defended valiantly and had chances to increase their lead on the break. Their historic win was fully merited and points towards a bright future for them. Swansea, meanwhile, need to perk up fast.Man of the match Kemar Roofe (Oxford)

Notts County have appointed the former Crystal Palace midfielder Jamie Fullarton as the club’s new manager. The League Two club had been without a manager following the sacking of Ricardo Moniz on 30 December.Notts County sack manager Ricardo Moniz and backroom staff Read moreThe 41-year-old had spent time this season in charge of the Championship side Nottingham Forest’s development squad, after leaving Bolton in 2014.The Notts County chairman, Ray Trew, says he was impressed after holding talks with Fullarton.“I don’t think I have ever been as impressed by someone at an interview as I was by Jamie,” said Trew. “He had us all captivated throughout what turned out to be a lengthy assessment of his suitability for the role.“I’ve got to stress that we had an incredibly high standard of applicant for the vacancy, some of whom were unable to commit to the role to the level we were looking for and some who gave us plenty to think about when it came to conducting the interviews.“However, when Jamie came in for his interview we all agreed that he stood out as the man that we wanted to take on this exciting challenge, with his meticulous attention to detail and his mix of self-awareness and self-assurance shining through.”Fullarton will take charge of first team duties from Monday before taking his new side to Crawley Town on Saturday.A former Scotland Under-21 international, Fullarton also had playing spells at St Mirren, Brentford and Southend.Fullarton admits he is relishing the task of managing the world’s oldest Football League club. “I am delighted and excited by the prospect of managing such a great club as Notts County, laced with history and tradition,” said Fullarton.“To manage a club which has in place an infrastructure, strategy and vision off the pitch that provides a genuine opportunity to be successful on the pitch is a fantastic foundation to build upon.”The Magpies are currently 18th in League Two and without a win in their last four matches.

Zinedine Zidane is a change for the better at Real Madrid, says Luca Modric
~CONTENTS~
Real Madrid’s midfielder Luka Modric believes Saturday’s 5-0 drubbing of Deportivo La Coruna in La Liga in Zinedine Zidane’s debut as the club’s manager shows the former Real and France great is the right man for the job.Modric, a Croatia international, said he was sorry for Rafa Benítez, sacked and replaced by Zidane last week after less than half a season in charge, but that somebody had needed to pay the price for an indifferent run of results.Gareth Bale claimed a hat-trick and Karim Benzema scored twice at the Bernabeu, where fans were united in hailing their hero Zidane, as third-placed Real closed to within a point of Atlético Madrid, who play at Celta Vigo on Sunday.Barcelona, who have a game in hand, are a point ahead of Atlético after they thrashed Granada 4-0 at the Camp Nou on Saturday.“I am sorry for Rafa and I would like to thank him for his work, but being honest and seeing today’s game I think that the change has been positive,” Modric said. “When you lose there is always someone who has to pay.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest  Zinedine Zidane speaks after first match as Real Madrid coach – video“You just have to compare this match with the previous ones. The team’s attitude was different and hopefully we can continue in the same way.”One of the reasons the Real president Florentino Pérez decided to discard BenEítez and promote Zidane from the B team coach was the apparent breakdown in the old coach’s relationship with dressing-room heavyweights such as Cristiano Ronaldo and James Rodriguez. The change in the dynamic with Zidane at the helm was palpable on Saturday, with the players looking more determined and committed and working hard for each other in attack and defence.“We played a lot more rapidly and we functioned as a team in the way was always should function,” Modric said. “Today we were a team from the start, up front, at the back and in the middle.“What we did against Deportivo was to pressure higher up the pitch and win back a lot of balls and when we had possession we were very dangerous.”Real’s next match is a La Liga game at home to Sporting Gijón next weekend. They play the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie at AS Roma on 17 February.

Yaya Touré’s agent has claimed Pep Guardiola is overrated as a manager and admitted he is concerned he could look to get rid of the 32-year-old should he take over at Manchester City.Pep Guardiola is putting Manuel Pellegrini in the shade | Daniel Taylor Read moreThe Bayern Munich manager, who is favourite to take over from Manuel Pellegrini at the end of the season after revealing he wants to work in the Premier League, sold Touré when the pair were at Barcelona.Dimitri Seluk told the Sunday Mirror: “Pep is a great coach.

I’d like to see Pep take a club that is eighth or ninth and make them champions.”Guardiola sold Touré to City in 2010, the Ivorian not fitting into his plans for Barcelona.

Brisbane Roar move back into W-League title contention with third win in four
~CONTENTS~
Brisbane Roar’s woes are fast becoming a distant memory after a one-sided 4-0 win over Melbourne Victory on the Gold Coast on Sunday lifted them to fourth in the W-League.A third win in the past four outings has the five-time grand finalists enjoying strong momentum as they head for a final-round shoot-out with Adelaide United and Newcastle Jets for the competition’s remaining play-off berth.Newcastle Jets crash to open up W-League semi-finals race Read moreBrisbane raced out of the blocks scoring three times inside the opening half-hour to put the game to bed and ensure Melbourne Victory collected the wooden spoon for the first time.International trio Clare Polkinghorne, Katrina Gorry and Kirsty Yallop all got on the scoresheet against a flat Victory in warm conditions.The Roar dominated possession and were constantly faster on the flanks, but it took until the final minute before Angela Beard extended the margin.Adelaide’s hopes nose-dived with a shock 2-1 defeat in an action-packed encounter against Perth Glory on Sunday evening. American midfielder Vanessa Di Bernardo scored twice for a Glory side only playing for pride.That result leaves Roar with a three-point advantage and facing an easier final-round challenge against a stumbling Newcastle Jets, while Adelaide must tackle a Canberra United side unbeaten in their past eight outings.Canberra, who are assured of second spot, collected a routine 3-0 win over Western Sydney Wanderers in the nation’s capital.United were without superstar pair Michelle Heyman and Lydia Williams, but eased to an early lead through Caitlin Munoz and Rebecca Kiting, before Ashleigh Sykes iced the cake.Saturday’s only match saw Sydney FC confirm third spot with a 2-0 win over Newcastle Jets as Matildas duo Kyah Simon and Leena Khamis netted either side of half-time.A untimely run of poor form has left the Jets three points adrift of fourth and they now need an unlikely set of results next weekend to end their seven-year finals drought.

Saturday Sundae: Goodison Cat versus Anfield Cat; plus Eastleigh’s tweet
~CONTENTS~
Goodison Cat v Anfield Cat - how they compare1) Swagger: Goodison’s cat turned up in Everton’s penalty area late on in Saturday’s FA Cup third round game and struck a pose for cameras – until keeper Joel Robles shooed it and it lost its poise. Anfield’s cat, which turned up at Liverpool v Spurs in 2012, stayed cool throughout his cameo: cold-shouldering Brad Friedel, he waited for a steward to carry him off.2) Social media impact: @AnfieldCat had 30,000 followers inside 24 hours; @GoodisonCat was still struggling to pass 40 post-match.3) Outcome: @AnfieldCat, known as Kenny, Shanks or Socks, was placed in a foster care centre post-match, but ran off a month later. Goodison’s cat, though, could have a future in the game. “I thought he had great style and movement,” said Roberto Martínez. “He’s a young cat who’ll make mistakes. I don’t want to put any pressure on him.”Man of the daySergio Agüero – scored one and created one as City cantered past Norwich.Most consistentThe half-time scores in Manchester United’s last 10 home games: 0-0, 0-0, 0-0, 0-0, 0-0, 0-0, 0-1, 0-0, 0-0, 0-0. Their first shot on target against Sheffield United came in the 69th minute – earning an ovation.Best celebrationTheo Walcott gave a young fan the Sonny Bill Williams treatment at Arsenal: inviting him on to the pitch for a jumping bump celebration, then handing over his shirt.Tweet of the day‘GOALLLLLLLLLLLLLL ABSOLUTE SCENES AT THE SILVERLAKE’ – @eastleighfc, playing it cool.Best finaleA YouTube classic-in-waiting.

Wellington Phoenix and Brisbane Roar play out goalless A-League draw
~CONTENTS~
An overturned penalty cost Brisbane Roar dearly as Wellington Phoenix scrapped their way to a scoreless draw at Westpac Stadium on Sunday.The draw halted Brisbane’s four-game winning streak in a match which might have lacked goals, but was not short on excitement. Both teams ran themselves to a standstill in front of a vocal 7,774-strong crowd, with chances coming at both ends right until the final whistle.Melbourne City end Western Sydney Wanderers' lengthy unbeaten streak Read moreReferee Stephen Lucas’s decision to overturn a 32nd minute penalty after consulting his assistant proved a key moment for the Roar, who were denied time and again by the Phoenix’s makeshift defence.Brisbane had soaked up the early pressure before finding their timing in the front third, with Thomas Broich looking particularly threatening down the left flank.The Roar were without their young guns up front, leading goal scorers Jamie Maclaren and Brandon Borrello on Olyroos duty. But Costa Rican striker Jean Carlos Solorzano stepped up in his first start of the season, proving a real handful.Brisbane’s hard work looked to have paid off in the 32nd minute when central defender Andrew Durante was judged to have handled in the box as he headed a clearance after a Broich header rocketed back off the crossbar.But referee Lucas overturned the decision after consulting his assistant, ruling instead that Henrique had pushed the Wellington skipper and then awarded a free kick to the home team.Henrique and Solorzano featured again four minutes from halftime, Henrique finding space down the right before centering for Solorzano, whose well-struck shot was deflected wide by Moss’s left foot.Neither team took a step back in a full-on second stanza, Brisbane looking particularly threatening as the hour mark ticked over.Dimitri Petratos slid a beautiful ball into Henrique, only for stand-in centre back Dylan Fox to steal the ball off the Brazilian’s toe at the last minute.And Wellington were denied an injury-time winner when Kwabena Appiah saw his scrambled effort blocked by Jade North as the ball ballooned over the crossbar.

Chelsea’s Guus Hiddink retains fond focus on FA Cup before Scunthorpe tie
~~AUTHOR~~
Simon Burnton
~CONTENTS~
Guus Hiddink has never lost a game in the FA Cup and with Scunthorpe aiming to emulate on Sunday afternoon what Bradford so memorably and humiliatingly achieved in last season’s fourth round by beating Chelsea at Stamford Bridge he has no intention of starting now.With a round of Premier League games scheduled for midweek, when the champions will host West Bromwich Albion, and his employers desperate to improve their current 14th position in the table, Hiddink could be excused for making sweeping changes to his side to play a team 15th in League One and that boast a single victory from their past six league games. But while a couple of unfamiliar young faces might find their way into Sunday’s squad, he said: “We take the FA Cup seriously. I’m not changing five, six, seven players to bring in five, six, seven players from the academy.”Guus Hiddink: Diego Costa and Oscar like bulls in Chelsea training clash Read moreHiddink guided Chelsea to FA Cup success in 2009 and though he politely evaded the suggestion that it might be his greatest moment in management – he did, after all, win six league titles and a European Cup with PSV Eindhoven and the Intercontinental Cup with Real Madrid – he described it as “an achievement which is considered worldwide as a huge achievement”. “The impact of the FA Cup is huge worldwide,” he said. “You get an impact from Australia to Asia to the United States. It’s huge.”What with the much-publicised training-ground spat between Diego Costa and Oscar the squad have had other things to talk about than their memories of losing to Bradford but their coach sees no need to remind them. “I haven’t heard anyone talking about it, but we take it seriously,” he said. “We see the concentration in training. They are not going into this game as a game [they feel forced] to play, no, they’re eager to play. And the people I have around me, they have that feeling as well. [First team coach] Steve Holland, he’s very aware of not falling a second time into the trap.”Asked whether, during a career in management that is approaching the end of its third decade, he has ever been the victim of a giantkilling, Hiddink sat silent for a few moments and then shook his head. “Not that we were as a favourite beaten by a club,” he said. “Not one that you say: ‘Oh, I feel embarrassment about getting knocked out.’”Hiddink continues to insist that he will not be in charge of Chelsea next season, but may continue to have some involvement.“I’ve come back here with a lot of affection for the club. I don’t say I will stop with Chelsea after 28 May.”Hiddink is likely to have the striker Radamel Falcao as part of his squad until then, after Monaco ruled out taking him back early. The on-loan Colombian has struggled to make a contribution and has not featured at all since the end of October due to a thigh injury, on which he underwent checks at Monaco’s training ground last week.Monaco’s vice-president Vadim Vasilyev said: “He has six to eight weeks to go with this injury. We have decided not to take him back for the moment.”

Divock Origi injury worsens Liverpool’s problems up front

Andy Hunter
~CONTENTS~
Liverpool have been dealt a fresh injury blow after the striker Divock Origi underwent surgery on a knee problem that will sideline the Belgium international for another month.The 20-year-old has been absent since suffering a hamstring strain in the 1-0 win over Leicester City on Boxing Day. He had been scheduled to make a comeback against Arsenal or Manchester United in the Premier League this week only for a separate knee injury to postpone the comeback.Origi returned to Belgium for the procedure and it could be late February before he is available to Jürgen Klopp again, ruling him out of at least five league matches plus the FA Cup third-round replay against Exeter City and the second leg of the Capital One Cup semi-final against Stoke City.Klopp is already without the strikers Danny Ings and Daniel Sturridge due to injury, the former Burnley player for the rest of the season because of a ruptured cruciate and the England international as he works on a training regime designed to improve his dreadful injury record.Sturridge has been on the programme since recovering from a hamstring injury sustained at Newcastle United on 6 December but is not in contention to face Arsenal on Wednesday. The injuries mean Klopp has only Christian Benteke of his recognised forwards available against Arsène Wenger’s side but may recall Roberto Firmino in an advanced role.

Steve McClaren urges Newcastle United owner Mike Ashley to splash cash
~~AUTHOR~~
Louise Taylor
~CONTENTS~
It was not a typical cry for help and it was delivered in a between-the-lines, slightly coded manner but the sense of urgency underlying Steve McClaren’s latest appeal for new signings should not be ignored.Newcastle United’s manager remains in desperate need of a striker and has made it clear that, if a reliable scorer – or preferably two – fails to arrive on Tyneside this month, relegation could beckon.Asked if he was doing everything possible with the players at his disposal, McClaren said: “Absolutely. The most difficult thing is not to get too frustrated. I genuinely think the players are giving everything.”Considering Newcastle are third bottom of the Premier League and Manchester United are visiting on Tuesday night this collective effort is clearly not enough. Although the club have completed the signing of Henri Saivet, a 25-year-old Senegal midfielder, for an undisclosed fee believed to be around £4.5m from Bordeaux, there is a sense that nothing will change unless increased attacking firepower arrives. “It’s not rocket science,” said McClaren, whose side have lost their past four games in all competitions 1-0. “We’re just not putting the ball in the net. We’re not scoring enough goals to win games.”An obsession with privacy about transfer dealings at St James’ Park stemming from the club’s owner Mike Ashley, dictates that he needs to be extremely circumspect in his public utterances and cannot speak with the freedom which he would perhaps prefer.Newcastle agree Henri Saivet deal and target Swansea’s Jonjo Shelvey Read moreAsked about reports Newcastle had offered £10m for the Swansea midfielder Jonjo Shelvey, his reply was typical McClaren. “That I can’t discuss,” he said. “It’s one of 100 names linked with us. We can’t comment until they’re through the door.” Whoever ends up signing will almost certainly arrive too late to play a significant role in a potentially season- defining week that could have a major impact on McClaren’s job security.The 54-year-old is under severe pressure to collect points from not only the Manchester United game but another home fixture, against West Ham United, on Saturday. “It’s a big week,” he acknowledged.Newcastle’s manager can point to a tightened defence and improved overall performances as indicators of progress but the fear is that without someone to support Aleksandar Mitrovic, the young, floundering Serbia centre-foward serving as his sole fit striker, defeats will continue to accumulate.If so, Lee Charnley, the club’s managing director, could see his position come under similar threat. Charnley campaigned to appoint McClaren after Alan Pardew left for Crystal Palace last January and has a vested interest in helping put things right.Newcastle’s apparent second choice for the job was Rémi Garde, struggling horribly at Aston Villa. But, like McClaren, Garde can point to his club’s policy of buying young players, often from France, as the source of the difficulties.Aware recruitment is a highly sensitive issue, there are signs Charnley has encouraged Mike Ashley to start allowing McClaren some say on transfers, a hint the manager’s position on the club’s board may not be quite as semantic as thought.“I know what’s going on,” maintained McClaren, who is understood to be increasingly voicing his opinions on the need to sign experienced, ideally British, players possessing leadership traits. Whether or not he is being listened to should become apparent at the end of the month.“If we weren’t doing everything to rectify things, I’d be worried,” he said. “If people weren’t backing me or trying to, I’d be worried.”The fear is that, should Newcastle disappoint on Tuesday night, the crowd could turn hostile. A foretaste of discontent came when Florian Thauvin, the underachieving £13m winger signed from Marseille last summer, was serenaded with chants of ‘You’re not fit to wear the shirt” from away fans during Saturday’s FA Cup defeat at Watford.Perhaps fortunately, an ankle injury means Thauvin will miss the next two games. “We all have sympathy with Florian,” McClaren said. “It’s tough for him but we’re sticking by him.”He expressed satisfaction with the display at Watford but was reminded that playing well and losing is not great for fragile dressing-room morale. “Absolutely right,” he said. “How long before the players don’t keep coming back? How much does their frustration eventually boil over? It’s a good question.”Charnley and Ashley have been warned.

Sam Allardyce admits Dame N’Doye is a ‘calculated risk’ for Sunderland
~~AUTHOR~~
Louise Taylor
~CONTENTS~
Sam Allardyce has described Sunderland’s imminent signing of Dame N’Doye as a “calculated risk” but hopes the striker will help keep the club in the Premier League.The 30-year-old Senegal forward, sold to Turkey’s Trabzonspor for £2.2m by Hull last summer, was close to finalising a move to Wearside on Monday night. N’Doye is set to arrive on a six-month loan with a view to a permanent signing and Allardyce is hoping he can reprise his form on Humberside where he scored five goals in 12 games last season.“I hope Dame can emulate that for us or do even better,” said Sunderland’s manager, who is desperate not to follow Hull’s example and end up in the Championship. “It’s a calculated risk. The biggest thing is the quality of the player. If you think he has got that quality to make a difference. The gamble is, can they do it straight away? If they can’t, the games slip by and by the time they get used to it, it is too late.”His instinct is that N’Doye, who joined Hull for £3m from Lokomotiv Moscow a year ago, can adapt quickly. “Having had that experience last year, when Hull were struggling, and scoring on a regular basis can be very important for him settling in straight away and scoring for us,” said Allardyce, who hopes to further strengthen his squad and could play his new £750,000 former Bayern Munich reserve defender Jan Kirchhoff at Swansea on Wednesday.Sunderland complete signing of Jan Kirchhoff from Bayern Munich Read moreHe spoke to Steve Bruce about N’Doye and liked what he heard from the Hull manager. “What Steve told me helped me make my decision,” he said. “Dame is currently a frustrated player who hasn’t hit it off in Turkey and wants to come back to England because they all want to come back, they all want to play in the Premier League.“If Dame hits the ground running and scores goals like he did last year his goals are going to save us. He offers us more goals. At the moment Jermain Defoe is our only player with a regular scoring record.”N’Doye will not be available to face Swansea because he will need a visa and a work permit before gaining clearance to play. With such formalities regarded as straightforward, Allardyce hopes to be able to include him at Tottenham Hotspur on Saturday.

Louis van Gaal finally admits Manchester United bore him too
~~AUTHOR~~
Daniel Taylor
~CONTENTS~
 Louis van Gaal has admitted there have been times this season when Manchester United have left him feeling “bored or angry”, following a run of low-scoring games that has led to sustained criticism of the manager and accusations he has abandoned the club’s attacking principles.Van Gaal’s team made such a struggle of beating Sheffield United, ninth in League One, in the FA Cup on Saturday there were ironic cheers after a shot at goal and Paul Scholes, in his role as a television pundit, said the manager looked bored on the touchline, along with just about everyone else watching the match.The same complaint has followed United throughout much of Van Gaal’s reign but this is the first time he has confessed to finding their performances monotonous and, though he continued to defend his team against the “very negative” media, he said he understood the supporters’ dark humour.“There are matches that I have enjoyed very much. Against Chelsea I enjoyed it but the result was 0-0 and we could have lost. There are also matches where I’m very bored or angry because we are not disorganising our opponent’s defence but that is football. It’s not every match that every club is playing fantastically, football that attracts the people.“They have been ironic [against Sheffield United] but that’s an expression of the fans and that’s good. The players were frustrated and the fans were frustrated. But the fans also have to know we can’t always play fantastic football and that was also the case in former days when it didn’t happen. I’m sorry about that, but it is like that.”United are fifth in the Premier League, nine points behind the leaders, Arsenal, and endured an eight-match winless run before beating Swansea City in their last league fixture. The manager’s job has come under scrutiny and it was put to him that his assistant Ryan Giggs came from the same background as Scholes and Gary Neville, another regular critic, and must want more adventurous football. “I want that also,” Van Gaal said. “We have to be able to do that. But that’s why an opponent is there and they want to prevent us from doing that.”Van Gaal, who will be missing the injured Bastian Schweinsteiger for the trip to St James’ Park, described Newcastle as “playing very well” despite their position in the Premier League’s relegation places.

Arsène Wenger rejects Jürgen Klopp’s fixture congestion concerns
~~AUTHOR~~
James Riach
~CONTENTS~
Arsène Wenger believes Premier League clubs should have the strength in depth to cope with the winter fixture list, despite Jürgen Klopp’s warning to Pep Guardiola about the draining schedule in England.Liverpool’s Jürgen Klopp says respect for Arsène Wenger keeps growing Read moreKlopp faces Wenger for the first time as Liverpool manager at Anfield on Wednesday. Liverpool have sustained multiple injuries in recent weeks and Klopp, who took over as manager in October, has expressed his concern at the number of matches in December and January.He warned Guardiola, who wants to join a Premier League club before next season, that in England it is “football, football, football” and revealed his surprise that the Capital One Cup semi-finals were played over two legs. Wenger, who will attempt to extend Arsenal’s lead at the top of the table, said the schedule was usually a shock for overseas coaches arriving in England but that teams should be able to deal with the pressure.Asked about Klopp’s comments, the Arsenal manager said: “You get that from everybody who comes to England at the start because you have to adapt to the English style. I was like that and I’m still in favour of a winter break – but without losing the traditions of English football. That is play over Christmas and maybe have a break in January.Liverpool set to finalise loan move for QPR defender Steven Caulker Read more“But I believe as well that we go a little bit overboard because today the English clubs are in a financial situation to have a squad of 25 top-level players. It’s not like it was 25 years ago, so we cannot always complain that we play too much because we have players who can rotate, players who want to play.“In every club now, when I look at the bench, I am quite impressed with the players who are there and can play, so I don’t believe that it’s like we have 13 players who have to play every single game.“I believe that for the Germans they are maybe more surprised as they have a good winter break.” Wenger also pointed out that Bundesliga clubs play only 34 league matches and have no League Cup competition.Mesut Özil and Mathieu Flamini are expected to return for Arsenal following the FA Cup victory over Sunderland. Alexis Sánchez could feature against Stoke at the weekend for the first time since suffering a hamstring injury in November. Wenger also confirmed he is expecting the Egypt midfielder Mohamed Elneny to join this week once the relevant paperwork is completed.Divock Origi injury worsens Liverpool’s problems up front Read moreLiverpool have played only two matches at Anfield out of their past 10 in all competitions. Arsenal, in contrast, have played four of their past five at home and are unbeaten since a 4-0 defeat at Southampton on Boxing Day.While Klopp was manager of Borussia Dortmund he and Wenger had a relatively even record when their teams met, with Klopp describing Arsenal’s football as “like an orchestra” whereas he preferred heavy metal.When asked about the challenges that Liverpool’s pressing style would pose, Wenger said: “We are used to that pressing – it is not just Liverpool who do that, everybody in the modern game [does].“Pressing has been created in England basically because there is a history of teams who have done that very well, so it is part of the modern game to make quick decisions, be very short with your first touch and play your game.“I think he is a great manager but we have different styles. And you have to respect that and you can only be successful by being your own style and personality and everybody has a different personality. But I think he done very well in the job. You have to play with your style and what you believe is strong.”

Liverpool’s Jürgen Klopp says respect for Arsène Wenger keeps growing

Andy Hunter
~CONTENTS~
Jürgen Klopp has said his experience in the Premier League has increased his admiration for Arsène Wenger and warned Liverpool will not beat Arsenal by matching their possession game at Anfield.The Liverpool manager says his injury-hit side can defeat the Premier League leaders and will have “a solution” for Wednesday’s match when, unlike during Friday’s FA Cup tie at Exeter City, he will have a recognisable team available. But Klopp says a plan based on Arsenal’s style will be doomed to failure and Liverpool must focus on the traits that produced impressive wins at Chelsea and Manchester City prior to their recent inconsistent run.Liverpool set to finalise loan move for QPR defender Steven Caulker Read more“Arsenal and Arsène have their own style. It’s possession football, so it’s clear that, if we want to play the same way, we will be without a chance because they’ve been doing it for longer,” Klopp said.“Arsenal are not only a good possession team. That’s the problem. They have good counterattacks, too, and that’s what you have to be aware of. It’s a job but it’s a really nice job to think about solutions and how to stop them coming through with their plan. I like things like this.Divock Origi injury worsens Liverpool’s problems up front Read more“It is always a big challenge to play these clubs but, if we showed something in these last weeks, it is that we have something like a plan against good football teams.”Klopp said beating the league leaders was “not easy but it’s possible” and that his appreciation of Wenger, who marks his 20th anniversary as Arsenal manager this year, has grown since he arrived in the Premier League three months ago.“It is an absolutely amazing achievement and my respect grows day by day because it’s really intensive in the Premier League, especially with a team with international matches too,” said the former Borussia Dortmund coach.“My respect has grown since I’m here. He’s done a brilliant job, one of the best managers in the world. It’s rare to do this over such a long period. It’s always a challenge to play against him and it is a challenge I’m looking forward to.“Arsenal, together with Manchester City, are the two best teams at this moment in the Premier League. To stay in a good position against City they need all the points and they cannot decide where they get them. They will show us they are ambitious this season. They are in a good moment.”Liverpool’s injury problems have alleviated slightly ahead of Arsenal’s visit although Divock Origi faces another month on the sidelines after undergoing surgery on a knee problem that will sideline the Belgium international for another month. However, Mamadou Sakho is pushing for a start alongside Kolo Touré in defence and the captain, Jordan Henderson, is also available.Klopp had no established central defenders available against Exeter but may have the relative luxury of having two on Wednesday. Touré is fit having missed the trip to St James Park while recovering from cramp sustained in the Capital One Cup semi-final win at Stoke City. Sakho has not featured since aggravating a knee injury at West Ham United on 2 January but is expected to return to fitness in time, easing Klopp’s selection headache having had to select Tiago Ilori and Jose Enrique in the FA Cup.Dejan Lovren has recovered more quickly than anticipated from a hamstring injury and could be available for Manchester United’s visit on Sunday, although Arsenal will come too soon, while Nathaniel Clyne, Alberto Moreno, Lucas Leiva, Emre Can and Roberto Firmino will all return having been rested on Friday.“The situation now is better than two or three days before,” Klopp said.He did not mention Ilori in his list of available central defenders. “I think Kolo will be available so we will have one senior centre-back. Mama wants to be available and hopefully we can use him. Martin [Skrtel] is still a few weeks. Dejan the time of injury was only six days [and needs] something like eight or 12, so it’s close. There will be a moment if it’s a risk if we can try, but it’s not a moment for this yet. We have to look for Kolo and Mama and then the next one is Lucas.”Klopp also confirmed Henderson has recovered from a heel problem that had sidelined him since the win at Sunderland on 30 December and Jordon Ibe will be available despite a hamstring concern. Daniel Sturridge remains injured.

Louis van Gaal forced to defend his art but stats paint bleak picture
~~AUTHOR~~
Daniel Taylor
~CONTENTS~
These are the moments when it may be appropriate to remember the way Ed Woodward, Manchester United’s chief executive, ushered Louis van Gaal into the job, back in happier times when it was inconceivable that 18 months down the line even the manager would be admitting that, yes, he too has been bored by their repetitive dreariness.“He’s got incredible energy and, very importantly, he likes attacking football,” Woodward said of Van Gaal on the day he took over from David Moyes. “If you remember the Barcelona team he managed in the late 90s, they played incredible, attacking football and those games we had against them in 1998-99, that’s the kind of football Manchester United fans love. It’s part of our DNA.”Louis van Gaal finally admits Manchester United bore him too Read moreIt always seemed slightly generous when Maarten Meijer, Van Gaal’s biographer, remembers the Dutchman’s first spell at Camp Nou for his “belief in tactical rigour” bringing him into conflict with many of his players and meaning “the team always seemed on the verge of imploding”. Van Gaal won trophies but his rigid system meant he had little time for Rivaldo or indeed the club’s other Brazilians. “Van Gaal left the club with a good record but struggled throughout to connect with the Catalan fans,” Meijer writes.They did not seem particularly happy at Old Trafford either during Saturday’s FA Cup tie against Sheffield United when Van Gaal’s team clocked up 10 successive home games where they have not managed a first-half goal and eventually scraped through with a stoppage-time penalty. It has become a recurring theme and makes Old Trafford, goals-wise, officially the most boring ground in England’s four professional leagues, featuring 16 goals for both home and away side in total – the lowest figure of all 92 clubs, followed by Blackburn Rovers (18), Stoke City and Aston Villa (19) and Bradford City (20).At Europe’s other superpowers, Van Gaal would almost certainly have lost his job after what has been, for United, the worst run in a quarter of a century. That, however, was not something he wanted to contemplate when it was put to him that Barcelona, for example, would have moved him out. “You are suggesting and then I have to answer,” he said. “I don’t want to answer on suggestions.”His team have, in fairness, won their last two games going into Tuesday’s trip to Newcastle United but the style of play has not just led to lacerating comments from Paul Scholes and the other former United players Van Gaal calls “the legends” now offering their thoughts as television analysts. There were ironic cheers when Memphis Depay, a substitute, tried a shot at the weekend and a large-scale walkout before the final whistle, to a degree that never used to happen when the team had a reputation for late goals and drama.Van Gaal, describing journalists as “very negative” for pursuing this line, accepted the crowd had probably not been anticipating a goal. “They are not thinking we could score. But also maybe it’s because of the traffic. As a manager, when I went to matches to analyse opponents I have done that as well. I would leave the stadium five minutes before the end.”It can get pretty snarled up on Chester Road but the point is that the fans have not liked what they have seen for a long time. “I can understand that,” Van Gaal said about the crowd’s reaction. “It was a fact that we were not shooting too much. They were ironic [cheers], I can imagine.”In a different era Sir Alex Ferguson would go to the touchline if he was unhappy with the way the team were playing. Van Gaal, however, did not like the suggestion that he should try the same. “I’m not Sir Alex, as you know. Everybody is different and I don’t believe in yelling from the sidelines. I believe in communication during the week, during the preparation and I believe in my players who have to perform.”Instead Van Gaal continues to insist it was the right decision to go into the season with so few attackers, on the basis that he does not like competition for places. “Our difficulty is not our defensive organisation – that you can see. But the stats in the attacking direction are not so good so we have to improve that part, especially in the third and fourth phase. That is where our intention is going, too. At this moment we have a lack of creativity. We have to lift that and we are very busy with that.“Every week I’m saying we have to improve in the third or fourth phase.”

Newcastle sign Bordeaux’s Henri Saivet to bolster midfield
~CONTENTS~
Newcastle United’s Steve McClaren has made his first January signing with the capture of the Bordeaux midfielder Henri Saivet.The 25-year-old Senegal international has joined Newcastle for an undisclosed fee, understood to be in the region of £5m, on a five-and-a-half-year contract.Saivet said: “I am very happy to be here at Newcastle. I am really proud to be able to play for this club and I am really excited at the challenge that lies ahead. St James’ Park is a really impressive and special stadium. In France there is nothing that compares to this and I can’t wait to get out there and help the team climb the table.”Newcastle are 18th in the Premier League and have lost their last four games in all competitions 1-0. McClaren will hope Saivet, who started his career as a winger but has played in central midfield for Bordeaux this season, is the first of several players to arrive at St James’ this month.He said: “Henri is someone the club has been watching for a while and he has developed into an excellent player at Bordeaux. This is someone with a very good mentality, who is a tough player and a winner. Those are key qualities you need in the Premier League.”Saivet came through the ranks at Bordeaux, making his senior debut at 17 and going on to score 23 goals in 178 appearances.

FA Cup fourth-round draw hands Manchester United trip to Derby County
~~AUTHOR~~
Simon Burnton
~CONTENTS~
An intriguing draw for the fourth round of the FA Cup has thrown up a maximum of three all-Premier League ties, with Arsenal the only top-six side who will play at home.FA Cup fourth-round draw – as it happened Read moreThe Cup holders will host Burnley, having won their last five meetings in the competition with the promotion-chasing Championship side by an aggregate score of 16-1.Eastleigh, the only non-league side still in the competition, were once again drawn at home to Championship opposition – Leeds United on this occasion – though they will first have to survive a replay against Bolton, with whom they drew 1-1 on Saturday, at the Macron Stadium.“It’s a great tie,” said their manager, Chris Todd. “It’s unbelievable for teams like Leeds and Bolton to be mentioned in the same breath as Eastleigh, that’s a massive achievement. We’ve done extremely well to get where we are and we’re very excited to have that challenge in front of us, against Bolton, and then the prize that we could achieve of playing Leeds at home which would be incredible really.”The only totally top-flight tie certain to be played sees Crystal Palace, who also had to beat Premier League opposition in the third round when they won 2-1 at Southampton, host Stoke. If Liverpool win their home replay against Exeter City they will welcome West Ham United, a prospect the Hammers’ chairman David Sullivan described as “not ideal but certainly not impossible”. Manchester City could also face Premier League opposition but only if Aston Villa come through their tie against Wycombe, who held them to a 1-1 draw at Adams Park on Saturday.Oxford United, whose 3-2 victory over Swansea was perhaps the finest of the third round so far, were rewarded with another home tie, even if their opponents – either Blackburn Rovers or Newport County – are probably not those they had dreamt of, with their appetites whetted by a pairing with Chelsea in the rehearsal.It may however present an opportunity to settle some personal scores. Oxford’s manager, Michael Appleton, endured a miserable 67-day stint at Ewood Park in 2013 while his assistant, Derek Fazackerley, is Blackburn’s record appearance-maker, having represented them 596 times in the league.Colchester, 23rd in League One, were rewarded for a victory over Charlton with a home game against either Tottenham or Leicester City. “It’s a great draw,” said their captain, Chris Porter. “They both have a lot of quality players so regardless of who they put out, it will be a good test. We’ve got to expect they’ll have a bit of possession, but the way we played against Charlton shows we can be hard to break down. If we can get a goal or two on the counter, who knows?”FA Cup: talking points from the third round Read moreManchester United will travel to Derby, second in the Championship, a match almost certain to become their 48th consecutive televised FA Cup tie. “It’s a fantastic draw and I am so pleased that we are at home as well,” said Paul Clement, the Derby manager. “It is certainly a game and an occasion to look forward to, one that we will all relish.”Chelsea will visit either Northampton, second in League Two, or the Championship side MK Dons. Of the remaining Premier League sides Watford will visit Nottingham Forest while Bournemouth travel either to Ipswich or Portsmouth. Carlisle United and Yeovil will be motivated for their replay by the prospect of welcoming Everton.“Everyone enjoys the FA Cup draw, and the excitement it brings but we have to make sure we keep our eyes on what is important,” said the Carlisle manager, Keith Curle. “The next challenge we face is Barnet, that’s where all of our thoughts will be focused this week.”FA Cup fourth round drawTies to be played over the weekend of Friday 29 JanuaryWest Bromwich Albion or Bristol City v Peterborough UnitedEastleigh or Bolton Wanderers v Leeds UnitedArsenal v BurnleyDerby County v Manchester UnitedHuddersfield Town or Reading v WalsallExeter City or Liverpool v West Ham UnitedWycombe Wanderers or Aston Villa v Manchester CityShrewsbury Town v Sheffield WednesdayNottingham Forest v WatfordCarlisle United or Yeovil Town v EvertonCrystal Palace v Stoke CityOxford United v Newport County or Blackburn RoversIpswich Town or Portsmouth v BournemouthColchester United v Tottenham Hotspur or Leicester CityBury or Bradford City v Hull CityNorthampton Town or MK Dons v Chelsea

Lionel Messi: a genius and antidote to football’s bloated excesses
~~AUTHOR~~
Barney Ronay
~CONTENTS~
Even Fifa gets it right sometimes. In front of the usual Zurich crowd of power brokers, buffet-lurkers, desiccated legends and appallingly tuxedoed superstars, Lionel Messi has been awarded the Ballon d’Or for 2015. And from a certain angle it is tempting simply to shrug, yawn and wonder what the fuss is about. Let’s be honest. This isn’t exactly news is it?Lionel Messi wins Ballon d’Or for record fifth time to defeat Cristiano Ronaldo Read moreFifa may be keen on casting itself as football’s key-master, overseer and general capo dei capi. But anyone with even a passing knowledge of Messi’s extraordinary feats between January and June last year knows already he has been, beyond even the tiniest crumb of doubt, the best footballer on the planet. In London earlier the same day David Cameron had also informed the world – no doubt to the world’s huge relief on this matter – that David Bowie was very good at music. In many ways Fifa’s annual pawing at the shoulders of greatness feels like it should draw a similar reaction. OK, then. Thanks for that, chaps. Anyway, where were we?The objections to Fifa’s glitzy, perma‑tanned operetta are familiar. There is a certain unease with star worship and swooning over individuals, not least when the major part of Messi’s own success has been the chemistry with that three-man Barça frontline.Connected to this is the hot, sweaty hand of marketing and sponsorship, the corporate opportunism that drives the wider hyperbole. Every single football-playing child in the world covets a pair of Adidas Messi boots (or failing that some Nike Mercurial Superfly CR7s). Harmless enough perhaps but it is worth remembering who drives the scale and reach of this strain of unceasing, glossily celebrified excitementPlus of course there is the jarring nature of any January award in a sport where the narrative of struggle and triumph runs on a separate calendar. The story has always been the season, the ability to perform and grow and problem-solve from autumn into winter into spring . This was the real satisfaction of Messi’s sensational 2014-15: a stumbling start, before the sublime, unanswerable lift-off from November to May, all given its greater meaning by those early stutters. The last six months of 2015 were the start of something else, a separate story half-told. But wait! Here comes Fifa with its golden ball and its glazed smiles and its iron grip on the sleeve. All hail what you’ve already seen ages ago!Ballon d'Or 2015 award: Messi wins for the fifth time – as it happened Read moreStill, though: it is somehow hard to argue this time around. Having railed against, having accepted all of this, the fact remains that there is never a bad moment to celebrate real genius. It is another part of Messi’s peculiarly generous type of brilliance that it is within his scope to redeem even Fifa’s overblown sideshow. And it is even for the award-sceptic a genuinely significant victory on several frontsFirst for Messi to regain his status as the world’s best player six years on from his first ballon and three years from his last is a supreme feat of longevity And beyond that, let’s face it, he has been sensationally, blissfully good. His performances from the start of January to the Champions League final, during which he scored 34 goals in 34 games and drove a thrilling champion team on to greatness, were relentlessly but also oddly vivid and moving. Here was a player who had looked physically diminished at the end of the 2014 World Cup, who appeared to have entered a period of adjustment and realignment, to have lost a little of his fearless youthful snap.Not so, it turned out. Messi didn’t just return to his previous level this year, he surpassed it. There were many superlative performances but frankly he deserves that gong simply for the champions league semi-final first leg against Bayern Munich. In the biggest game of the season, at a moment of history-minting importance, Messi was simply mesmerising. For 80 minutes he tickled and jabbed and lulled a team of world-class footballers into submission. The decisive blow to the point of the chin was a truly wonderful Messi moment as he drifted past Jérôme Boateng, who collapsed almost gratefully like a sleepwalker being ushered into an armchair, and then floated the ball over Manuel Neuer and Rafinha, leaving three opponents flat on their backs and an entire defence put to sleep in five perfect strides.There were plenty of other unforgettable moments. In February Messi produced a 20-minute spell of dribbling, passing and combination play that was, this observer feels like arguing – and it is a pointless but compelling debate – the best individual display of attacking football seen in England. This will no doubt draw guffaws of disagreement but if we accept the speed and intensity of the game keeps rising, and that Messi is among the top two or three players of all time, then why not?Carli Lloyd: complicated, inconsistent ... and officially the world's best Read moreCristiano Ronaldo was a worthy winner of an overblown award last year. This time Messi’s performances add a lustre to the circus itself. Given the all-round nature of his game as passer, dribbler, playmaker, provider of relentless gobbets of brilliance, perhaps the only real question is not whether he’s the best right now, or the best of his era, but whether he’s simply the best.Comparisons between eras are of course a fruitless business. The demands, the basic tone and texture, change all the time. Even so it is hard, watching Messi this year, to imagine anyone has ever played much better.There may be reservations about the Barça comfort zone too. The fact is Messi has only ever been constantly brilliant for one team. A team who, for 80% of his time there have been, even without him often, the best on the planet. Again this too seems a pointless objection given his relentlessly high level. He is what he is: Messi of Barcelona, a humble, steamrollering, endlessly reliable genius. And for the first time this year there is perhaps a sense we should really be squeezing the last drops out of this era of rare individual brilliance while it’s still out there. Ronaldo will be 31 next month. Messi is 29 in June. The only really valid point of comparison for these two era-defining players will be the hole they leave when they have gone. For now the best policy is perhaps simply to celebrate while we have them: stay glued, drink it in, don’t miss a second.

Lionel Messi wins Ballon d’Or for record fifth time
~CONTENTS~
Lionel Messi has won the Ballon d’Or for an unprecedented fifth time.The Barcelona forward reclaimed the biggest individual accolade in world football at a lavish ceremony in Zurich on Monday, beating Real Madrid’s Cristiano Ronaldo, the three-time winner whom he has been runner-up to for the last two years.Messi also finished ahead of his fellow Barça front-man Neymar after a calendar year in which the Catalan club claimed five titles.The Argentina international Messi, who scored 48 goals for his club in 2015, said after being presented with the award by the 2007 Ballon d’Or winner, Kaká: “It is a very special moment for me to be back here on this stage, winning again another Ballon d’Or after being there in the audience watching Cristiano win.“It’s incredible this is my fifth. It’s much more than anything I dreamed of as a kid.“I want to thank everyone who voted for me and I want to thank my team-mates. Without them none of this would be possible.“Lastly I want to thank football in general for everything it has brought me, both the bad and the good, because it has made me grow and learn.”In other awards USA’s Carli Lloyd capped a brilliant 2015 by taking home the award for women’s player of the year.Lloyd faced competition from Germany’s Celia Sasic and the Japan midfielder Aya Miyama but her performances at last year’s World Cup – including a brilliant hat-trick in the final – helped secure her the award for the top female player in the world.Lloyd is the third American to take home the award – Abby Wambach won in 2012 and Mia Hamm got the nod twice, in 2001 and 2002. Brazil’s Marta has the most wins with five.Lloyd has scored 79 goals in 211 appearances for USA and was recently made captain of the national team.

Carli Lloyd: complicated, inconsistent ... and officially the world's best
~~AUTHOR~~
Caitlin Murray
~CONTENTS~
Even going back years, it wasn’t an unusual sight at USA training: the players have finished cooling down and walk to the sideline, but Carli Lloyd is alone on the field, still doing push-ups.Over the years, she has become accustomed to people laughing at her obsession with hard work, but she has always argued that she’ll take a break when she retires. She has never been shy either about her ambitions to become the greatest player in the world, even if at times throughout her career that seemed a lofty dream.But now, Lloyd has earned the last laugh. As the new Fifa women’s player of the year, she is the greatest female soccer player in the world after delivering one of the greatest title performances in American sports history.Carli Lloyd: did we witness the greatest ever performance in a US title game? Read moreHer game-crushing, hat-trick in the Women’s World Cup final last summer has been called surreal, but not by Lloyd. Afterward, she told reporters in the press room that she envisioned it while she was doing sprints in training.The first goal came in just the third minute. In a major oversight, Japan failed on a corner kick to mark Lloyd, who scored the game-winner against the Nadeshiko in the 2012 Olympic final. She raced into the box and tapped the ball in. Two minutes later, the same thing happened again.But her third, audacious goal is the one that will forever symbolize the pinnacle Lloyd reached in 2015. She cut around a defender, saw the Japanese goalkeeper off her line and launched a shot from the half-way line, a jaw-dropping goal fitting for a World Cup final.As stunned as the Japanese players were, so too was the record-breaking audience watching the match on TV. Lloyd had produced a performance that is sure to go down in history as one of the greatest ever, almost single-handedly assuring the USA’s eventual 5-2 win.Though the World Cup final will be her pièce de résistance, the crowning achievement of her relentless work ethic, Lloyd’s impact for the national team had been crucial throughout her career and especially in 2015.She led the No 1-ranked USA in goals for the year at 18, her career high. It was Lloyd, as the big-goal hunter, who sparked the turning point in the quarter-finals after the USA’s early lackluster performances in the World Cup. Following that performance, she told reporters she would call her longtime trainer, James Galanis, and discuss ways to improve before the semi-final, where she again would score the game-winner and assist the insurance goal.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Lloyd is known as a clutch player, and for good reason. She scored the game-winning goals in both the 2008 and 2012 Olympics, even if her hat-trick at last year’s World Cup will eclipse those. She has a penchant for getting black eyes on the field and delivering crunching tackles.“I’m just rugged, raw, and I want to win,” said Lloyd at Monday’s award ceremony. “I will do whatever it takes.”But Lloyd is a complicated sports figure, whose apex in 2015 only came after peaks and valleys in a rollercoaster career. The goal-scoring machine of today was the turnover machine of yesterday. The clutch player of today was the player who choked in 2011, overshooting a penalty in the World Cup final.Sweden’s Pia Sundhage stirred controversy with comments ahead of the group-stage clash against USA, the team she used to coach, declaring Lloyd a challenge to manage. When the coaches had faith in Lloyd, she played well, Sundhage said, but when doubt crept in, her performance suffered.As it turns out, perhaps Sundhage’s comments weren’t so off base. For all of Lloyd’s ability, her best self only arrived in Canada when US coach Jill Ellis made a tactical shift that placed Lloyd closer to goal and unburdened her of defensive duties. Ellis had the faith to give Lloyd what she wanted: the freedom to prowl for goals, and that was when Lloyd was unleashed.Lloyd struggled so much in 2011 that by the time the Olympics came in 2012, Sundhage gave her starting spot to Shannon Boxx. But when Boxx was injured in the opening match of the tournament, Lloyd was forced to take over – and she had perhaps her best tournament up to that point.The prevailing criticism of Lloyd had always been that if only she were more consistent, she could be a top player in the world. But it’s almost as if the lack of consistency is what has helped her achieve new heights. For her, soccer is a constant act of self-improvement. One of her favorite things to tell reporters over the summer was that she just wanted to prove people wrong.In 2015, perhaps with memories of her last World Cup lingering, she dominated for her national team while she put her club career on hold. She was the player of the year and no one needed Fifa to make it official.If Lloyd stays true to her own history, it is a given that there will be periods when she does not resemble a world top player – most likely in off-cycles when her national team is playing friendlies and not tournaments. But she will surely bounce back as she always does. If not, her legacy as one of the greatest players to ever compete will surely live on anyway, the image of her long-distance goal lingering in the minds of everyone who witnessed her historic performance. Lloyd is a unique, complicated player and over the past 12 months, she was also undoubtedly the best in the world.

Bournemouth complete £8m return of Lewis Grabban from Norwich
~~AUTHOR~~
Ed Aarons
~CONTENTS~
Bournemouth have re-signed Lewis Grabban from Norwich for £8m only 24 hours after they spent a club-record £9m on another striker, Wolves’ Benik Afobe.Ballon d'Or 2015 award: Messi, Ronaldo and Neymar up for gong – live! Read moreGrabban, who moved to Carrow Road from Bournemouth in 2014 for around £3m, has been a target for Eddie Howe for some time and the manager had three bids for him turned down in the summer. At the time Norwich were reluctant to sell and suspended the former Crystal Palace trainee for leaving the team hotel without permission before their League Cup victory at Rotherham in August, despite being named on the bench.However, with Norwich hoping to complete the signing of Everton’s Steven Naismith for £8m, their manager, Alex Neil, has sanctioned Grabban’s departure, meaning Bournemouth have spent more than £20m on strikers since the end of August, having also signed Glenn Murray from Palace for an initial £3m.Grabban, who has scored one Premier League goal this season, against Arsenal at the end of November, will face stiff competition for a starting place at Bournemouth although he did find the net 22 times for them in the 2013-14 season. “So happy to have signed at Bmouth once again and can’t wait to get going,” the 27-year-old wrote on Twitter. “Thanks for all the messages welcoming me back.”Howe added: “We’re really pleased to be bringing Grabbs back to Bournemouth. It was such a long drawn out transfer but we’re delighted it’s been done.“He had such a good time for us, scored goals, worked incredibly hard and it’s a good fit for us. He’ll bring enthusiasm and the benefit of Grabbs is that he knows how we play.“I think we’ll be getting a better Lewis Grabban, but he’ll realise that we’ve got better as well and he will have to adapt too. But we’re in no doubt we’re getting a good player back.“He’s also someone who was popular in the dressing room, behind the scenes he’s a strong motivator and we’re delighted to be bringing him back.”The one-time Arsenal striker Afobe was unveiled on Monday having signed a four-and-half-year deal. His former manager, Arsène Wenger, said he was “very happy” for the 22-year-old while Howe is predicting big things for his new signing.“He is entering a new league and that is going to be a big experience for him but we believe he can make the step up,” Howe said. “He is strong, you just look at him and know he is going to be a handful but he has good technique.“I am excited by that because I think there is a lot of potential in him and he is a really good age, and I think there are a lot of good years ahead of him.”Bournemouth are still waiting for international clearance for Argentina’s Juan Iturbe, who signed on loan until the end of the season, but they hope he may be available for Tuesday night’s meetinghome home game with West Ham.Lewis Grabban (@grabbs22)So happy to have signed at Bmouth once again and can't wait to get going. 😁😁😁 Thanks for all the messages welcoming me back ❤️ 🍒January 11, 2016

Pepe Mel's second coming ends in tears after inciting Betis board to take action
~~AUTHOR~~
Sid Lowe
~CONTENTS~
“If Real Betis sack me, no problem,” Pepe Mel said, so Real Betis sacked him – two years and two months after the last time. History repeated itself, that same recurring dream: the one that starts with him riding to the rescue, resuscitating them, but ends in tears, the hero watching it all slip inexplicably through his fingers. The man who saved Betis twice and brought them back twice has now been fired twice; maybe next time he’ll think twice. Last time, he didn’t. “Betis is my team, the club of my life, where I am happy,” he said. That was December 2014; thirteen months on, he’s gone again, the news broken to him by everyone except the man who was supposed to break it to him.Mel watched the end come through a window at the Coliseum. Suspended, he spent Saturday night’s game against Getafe in a radio booth at the top of the main stand. Down below he saw chances go by, from Alfred N’Diaye in particular, and he saw Álvaro Vázquez squeeze in the game’s only goal for Getafe, making it eight games without a win for Betis, five without even scoring a goal. “Betis have to offer more and the coach is the man with the greatest responsibility,” he conceded afterwards. “I know what this world I’m part of is like and if Real Betis decide to sack me, no problem.” He knows, alright, and not just because of the results. Maybe not even because of the results.Former Swansea striker Michu rebuilding career in Spain’s fourth tier Read moreThe writing was on the wall. At the club’s training ground, there was graffiti attacking the manager and his “mercenary” players. When he arrived back at Santa Justa station, cameras followed him. “I’m so famous,” he smiled, sarcastically. The following day a board meeting was called for late afternoon and went on for five hours. When finally they’d agreed to sack him, it was almost eleven o’clock. They tried to call him, but his phone was off. He found out anyway; Mel saw his sacking on Twitter. “I’d like to apologise for that. Someone leaked it in the short time between deciding and being able to talk to him,” said the president, Juan Carlos Ollero. And so the circle was completed again: salvation, promotion, the sack. Top scorer when Betis won promotion to the first division in 1989-90, Mel first became the club’s manager in 2010. Relegated the previous season, they were “dead”, in the words of one player. Taken into administration, there was a legal battle over shares which is still not resolved - one which has seen them have six presidents in six years - and a power vacuum into which he stepped. Turning to him had made sense: he was a bético with a season ticket at the Benito Villamarín, a man who connected with the fans like few others. And above all he was cheap. It turned out he was also rather good.Real Betis sack Pepe Mel after eight games without a win Read moreDrawing mostly on young players, Beñat Exteberría, Adrián San Miguel and José Cañas among them, Mel took Betis to the title and back to the first division. The year after that, they qualified for Europe. But it did not last. Mel once claimed that he’d rather his daughter fell pregnant than Betis got relegated, and that was becoming a distinct possibility. The relegation, that is. Everything that could go wrong was going wrong: key players were injured or sold, the differences between him and the sporting director, Vlada Stosic, and others on the board were increasingly apparent, and ultras had invaded training. Results were bad and performances worse.Mel had rebuilt Betis but he was sacked fifteen weeks into the 2013-14 season after three and a half years in charge, with the team bottom. “This is the press conference I hope never to have to give,” he said, his voice cracking, his eyes stinging as the cameras flashed, getting up quickly and dashing behind the sponsors’ backdrop where he could shed a tear in private. Through the walls, fans could be heard chanting his name and throwing stones at the stadium. The support that had been his great strength had ultimately undermined him, serving to make him less popular with some directors, who resented his popularity and saw him as a manipulator of the masses. When they could act against him, they did.Fans waited for the manager outside, cheering him as he drove away. 385 days later, he drove back again. He’d been to West Brom in the meantime. “How have you changed?” he was asked. “I speak a bit of English now,” he said. Betis had changed too, or so it seemed: this was a different board now, a new president and a new era. Besides, they needed him. Things had not gone well without him; his departure had only made things worse, the institutional crisis engulfing them. Mel’s successor Juan Carlos Garrido lasted forty-eight mostly angry days as manager; “there are too many fronts open,” he complained. Gabi Calderón followed him and could do nothing to prevent relegation, Betis surrendering before a disastrous season was out. And under Julio Vázquez in the Second Division, there wasn’t much sign of them coming back.Atlético Madrid beat Celta Vigo to reclaim La Liga top from Barcelona Read moreBy winter 2014, they made a change. Vázquez was sacked, but no one else was signed yet. Betis had been looking for a manager for twenty-seven days, a deal virtually done with Fernando Vázquez, when they hit upon the idea of calling Mel. He was hanging around in the city doing nothing, after all. In fact, he was hanging round in the stadium most Sundays. He admitted that the first time was “traumatic,” that it had “hurt”, but he was optimistic and he was home. “Why had they waited so long?”, he was asked. “Good question,” Mel said. “But I want to be positive.”Interim manager Juan Merino had won four in a row, leaving to applause and the bumps from his players and stepping aside for Mel to take over with the team sixth, eight points off promotion. “We have to go up, come what may,” Mel said, and they did. With two weeks still to go they won the title with a 3-0 win over Alcorcón in front of 50,000 fans. They’d racked up eighty-four points. Under Mel their record read: won 15, draw 6, lost 1. “I hope this is the last promotion we ever have to win,” he said.It still might be, and not just because of the man who comes in. For now, incidentally, it is Merino again, but he is not expected to stay for long. Mel has been sacked with Betis fifteenth, five points from the relegation zone and three points off the top half, which is not so bad. But things have changed since last season, and there has been a sense that things are just not quite right. His daughter got married, for a start. Worse, she got married to a Sevillista - the son of former president José María Del Nido, a board member at the Sánchez Pizjuán.Betis have scored only thirteen goals all season, their plan mostly just to give the ball to Joaquín and hope that he can invent something. They have won once at home - and that was against David Moyes’s Real Sociedad. They were beaten at home by Sevilla in the Copa del Rey, meaning that in all likelihood, they will be knocked out tomorrow night. No one has scored fewer goals this season. And Mel’s relationship with the sporting director has become tense too. Not with Stosic this time but with Eduardo Macià, once of Liverpool. Eight players departed, ten arrived. The manager has not been impressed.In October graffiti at the training ground insisted: “If we have to be relegated to the third division, let it be with the man who brought us back to the first.” While an opinion is no more valid because the person holding it is also carrying a can of spray paint, that message has changed now. On Saturday night, fresh graffiti read: “Mel, you don’t feel the colours.” It was quite some accusation to level at someone with over three hundred games and three promotions to his name, as a player and a manager, and others are firmly on his side, the board blamed for another sacking that, on top of it all, was handled badly, but it was telling too.Betis was supposed to be the club where Mel was happiest, where he is most loved, but he has not been happy. A few weeks ago, he admitted that there were “other reasons” why it wasn’t working, things that he could not say, but increasingly he has said so, publicly pointing the finger at the construction of the squad. Which is rarely a good way of staying in a job; in fact, at times it felt almost like he wanted to be sacked. And on Saturday night, he said it. “If Real Betis sack me, no problem,” Pepe Mel said Real Betis did.Again.Talking points• Atlético Madrid are Winter Champions. (Sort of). They reach the half way stage of the season, when every team has played every other team once (sort of), at the top of the table after a hugely impressive 2-0 victory in Vigo. The first, scored by Antoine Griezmann was superb. Atlético stand four points clear of Real Madrid and two ahead of Barcelona, who have a game in hand to play, against Sporting (hence those sort of’s). They have conceded just eight goals in 19 games and are looking stronger all the time. “It was muddy, heavy and it wasn’t easy,” Carrasco said. Asked if Atlético are contenders, he replied: “If we’re top ...” pausing to add: “If we can keep on like this, we can do something important this year.”• Krychowiak kicked the floor, flew into the air and got a penalty for it Kevin Gameiro scored. It was the second of the game as Sevilla defeated Athletic 2-0. There was good news for Athletic, though: Raúl García was carried off but tests have shown that his injury is not as serious as first feared. Football Weekly: Liverpool survive, United bore, but Oxford shock Swansea in the FA Cup Read more• Perhaps the week’s best news came down in tercera ...• Eibar. 30 points. A European place. And deservedly so. Wow. “This is not us winning games by the skin of our teeth,” Mendilíbar said, quite rightly. “Of 19 games, we have probably only had two bad ones.”• Levante got a huge, huge win over Rayo Vallecano at the Ciutat de Valencia and Deyverson celebrated his strike by doing a bit of a Pat Cash, running over to the fans, climbing over the advertising boards and making his way through the crowd to his family, seven rows up, embracing his dad. It was the first time his family have been able to travel to Europe to see him play and it was such a special moment that when he got back to the pitch the referee was waiting for him too. With a yellow card.• Villarreal have now won six in a row but they won’t win much more if they play like this. That’s what coach Marcelino thinks anyway. “We produced two brilliant plays and nothing else,” he said. “If we play like this, we will drop a long way down the table.” For now, at least, they are fourth, on 39 points, having matched their best ever first half to a season. Roberto Soldado did it again. No, not score: assist. No one in La Liga has more assists than him. “I admit that [the attacking partnership] is the opposite way round to how I expected, but he’s playing very well,” Marcelino said.• Gary Neville’s Valencia were beaten 2-0 at Real Sociedad and are still awaiting their first league win under him.• Gareth Bale took a souvenir home from Zinedine Zidane’s first game in charge: the match ball. “We feel sorry for Rafa, but you only have to look at the performances, really,” Luka Modric said.• At least someone did. A week on and still no one from Real Madrid has bothered to explain the decision to sack Rafa Benítez, or even take responsibility for it. The president who called the media in to blame denounce a conspiracy against the club and insist that Benítez was not in danger and just needed to be “given time”, the president who sacked him just thirteen days after going on the radio to insist that he was the “solution”, decided that this time he didn’t need to answer questions. And nor, the following day, did the institutional director Emilio Butragueño. “That doesn’t matter now,” he said. No contrition, just celebration. Barely even a thanks, or a goodbye. Certainly no apology. Instead, it is like Rafa Benítez never happened.“Five coaches since 2009. Is it always the manager’s fault?” Carlo Ancelotti said, saying much.• Messi scored a hat-trick and took home the match ball. Tonight he’ll probably take home the golden ball. Etc and so on. Results: Barcelona 4 -0 Granada, Getafe 1 - 0 Betis, Sevilla 2 - 0 Athletic, Real Madrid 5 - 0 Deportivo, Levante 2 - 1 Rayo, Villarreal 2 - 0 Sporting, Real Sociedad 2 - 0 Valencia, Eibar 2 - 1 Espanyol, Las Palmas 1 - 1 Málaga, Celta 0 - 2 Atlético.

Mamadou Sakho and Kolo Touré fit for Liverpool against Arsenal

~CONTENTS~
Jürgen Klopp’s selection problems have alleviated before Arsenal’s visit to Liverpool with Mamadou Sakho pushing for a start alongside Kolo Touré and the captain Jordan Henderson also available to face the Premier League leaders.Jürgen Klopp warns Pep Guardiola: England is football, football, football Read moreThe Liverpool manager was without any established central defenders for Friday’s FA Cup third-round draw at Exeter City but may have the relative luxury of having two for Wednesday’s game against Arsène Wenger’s side.Touré is fit having missed the trip to St James Park while recovering from cramp sustained in the Capital One Cup semi-final win at Stoke City. Sakho has not featured since aggravating a knee injury at West Ham United on 2 January but is expected to recover in time, easing Klopp’s selection issues after he had to select Tiago Ilori and José Enrique in the FA Cup.Dejan Lovren has recovered quicker than anticipated from a hamstring injury and could be available for Manchester United’s visit on Sunday, although Arsenal will come too soon.“The situation now is better than two or three days before,” said the Liverpool manager, who did not mention Ilori in his list of available central defenders. “I think Kolo will be available so we will have one senior centre-back. Mama wants to be available and hopefully we can use him. Martin [Skrtel] is still a few weeks.“Dejan – the time of injury was only six days [and he needs] something like eight or 12, so it’s close. There will be a moment if it’s a risk if we can try, but it’s not a moment for this yet. We have to look for Kolo and Mama and then the next one is Lucas.”Klopp said Henderson had recovered from a heel problem that had sidelined the midfielder since the win at Sunderland on 30 December and Jordon Ibe will be available despite a hamstring concern.

Hoofing a big gold football in the direction of Messi

IT’S A GOD AWFUL BIG AFFAIRAs assorted celebrities fall over each other in the stampede to see who can appear the most upset about the sad passing of a truly remarkable man and musician, the Fiver can’t help but wonder if any of them are as devastated as He will be if, as expected, Lionel Messi relieves Him of the Ballon d’Or at a swanky bash in Zurich’s Kongresshaus this evening. The Portuguese will certainly have to go some way to be as ungracious in defeat as Yaya Touré contrived to be upon discovering he’d lost his crown as African player of the year to Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang last week. “I think that’s what makes the shame of Africa,” said the big man after failing to win his fifth consecutive award. “To behave in this way is indecent! But what can we do?” What indeed? The shortlist for this year’s Ballon d’Or is made up of three names: Messi, Him and the other fella, who is unlikely to get a look in considering his rivals for the prize monopolised it for the past eight years. Indeed, so monotonous is the predictability with which one or other of them takes home the gong each year, that the colour of Messi’s latest wacky tuxedo and the identity of whatever lady turns up on His arm tend to be the main talking points before, during and after each ceremony. “Overall I’m not a big fan of it,” said Arsène Wenger in one of his super early-morning press briefings. “We are in a team sport. It is not logical just for individual effort. It is a bit contradictory to what is the route of our sport.” And a very happy Monday to you too, Arsène. The Fiver supposes you’ll be tuning into The One Show, where the FA Cup fourth round draw will be rubbing shoulders with features on a BMX-riding squirrel and the history of spectacle-wearing with Gyles Brandreth.As well as hoofing a big gold football in the direction of Messi, Fifa may also reward the Argentinian with one of the few individual footballing honours he has never won: the Puskás Award for best goal of the year. Messi is the favourite to win for his ridiculous individual effort against Athletic Bilbao in last year’s Copa del Rey final, but faces stiff competition in this category from Vila Nova’s Wendell Lira and the Fiver’s favourite scored by Roma’s Alessandro Florenzi.One of very few Britons in danger of being honoured at tonight’s beano is Mark Sampson, who helped England punch above their weight to finish third at the Women’s World Cup last summer. Tonight he will compete with USA! USA!! USA!!! boss Jill Ellis and Japan gaffer Norio Sasaki for the women’s coach of the year award. “Jill’s done great, she’s great,” said Sampson of his Portsmouth-born rival, who masterminded USA! USA!! USA!!!’s World Cup victory. “We’ve just seen Kaká. I’m going to enjoy this. It’s something I may never experience again.” Good luck to him this evening, at football’s freakiest show.LIVE ON BIG WEBSITEFollow the the Ballon d’Or gongathon with John Ashdown from around 5.30pm (UK time) and live coverage of The One Show (followed by the FA Cup fourth-round draw), with Michael Butler at 7pm.

Or words to that effect, anyway.Newcastle love the transfer window as much as anyone, and they’ve got their sights set on Swansea’s Jonjo Shelvey and Bordeaux’s Henri Saviet. So that’s two midfielders when they’ve only scored 19 goals all season. Cool.Rémi Garde wants Aston Villa owner Randy Lerner to talk to the club’s miffed fans so they’ll stop saying nasty things about his team, but someone will probably have to remind him that he does still own the club first.And the Kazakhstan FA has allowed fans the chance to vote online to say whether they want a foreign or homegrown national team manager. Unfortunately, no one seems to give a flying one so they’re unlikely to reach the number of votes needed for any of it to matter.

Letter: I played football with Don Howe
~CONTENTS~
I am ridiculously proud of having played football with Don Howe, albeit with a tennis ball at the Royal Artillery training camp in Oswestry, Shropshire, when he was an 18-year-old undertaking national service.Like all budding professional footballers called up for national service, Howe was sent to the regiment allocated to his club, in his case West Bromwich Albion, where he was already on the verge of the first team. I watched our regimental team play one from Donnington that included Manchester United players such as Bobby Charlton, and one from Catterick with Albert Quixall from Sheffield Wednesday.Howe was given a semi-sinecure as sports storeman, handing out kit for games and afterwards sending it to be laundered. Officers made sure he was available for training in return for in-demand tickets for the popular mid-1950s floodlit matches such as Wolves v Spartak Moscow.

Kazakhstan fans get to vote on country’s next national coach
~CONTENTS~
Kazakhstan fans could choose their country’s next coach in an online vote as part of a rare democratic experiment.Fans have been offered a choice between a Kazakh or foreign coach on the federation’s website. In the second round, fans will pick a name from a list of coaches, the federation spokesman Dmitry Nesterenko said.The candidates will all be realistic hires rather than global stars, Nesterenko said, with “basically, no Mourinho” who recently left Chelsea. However, the Central Asian nation’s foray into internet democracy has been hampered by low participation.The federation said 50,000 votes would be needed to consider the vote valid but barely 5% of that figure had been reached as of Monday evening, with only four days to go. There was a clear preference for a foreign coach, that option leading by 1,732 votes to 836.“There aren’t really any problems with popularising football. People go to the football, watch it, but I can’t say why no one is voting,” Nesterenko said.There is no guarantee all the votes were cast by Kazakh supporters. Registration is open to registered users of the federation’s website but there is nothing to stop foreigners from going through the automated registration process and casting votes.Football in Kazakhstan reached a milestone this season when Astana became the first Kazakh team to play in the group stage of the Champions League. While they did not qualify for the knockout stages, Astana managed to remain unbeaten at home in their group games.That success has yet to transfer to the national team, who failed to reach the European Championship in France, winning only one of 10 qualifying games. Kazakhstan’s past four coaches have been foreigners, most recently the Russian Yuri Krasnozhan.

Newcastle agree Henri Saivet deal and target Swansea’s Jonjo Shelvey
~CONTENTS~
Steve McClaren is hoping for a much-needed double transfer breakthrough as he attempts to drag Newcastle United out of yet another worrying tailspin.FA Cup: talking points from the third round Read moreThe Bordeaux midfielder Henri Saivet is understood to be on Tyneside on Monday to discuss a potential move, and the club are also understood to have formalised their long-held interest in Swansea’s Jonjo Shelvey.Saivet, a 25-year-old Senegal international, has spent much of his career playing as a winger but has occupied a central role for his club this season and will cost in excess of £4m. Bordeaux confirmed on Monday that they had reached a deal with Newcastle and McClaren said in his press conference that the player “was in the building” to have his medical.Newcastle United FC (@NUFC)McClaren confirmed that Henri Saviet is on Tyneside having a medical and discussing terms. "We are just waiting for the outcome." #NUFCJanuary 11, 2016Shelvey, who was coveted by Alan Pardew during the former Newcastle manager’s time at St James’ Park, appears to be heading out of Swansea after losing his place under first Garry Monk and then Alan Curtis.He was reportedly involved in a row with a Swansea fan following the club’s 3-2 FA Cup third round defeat by League Two Oxford on Sunday.Shelvey has been linked with a £10m switch to Newcastle as McClaren attempts to end a run of four consecutive 1-0 defeats to ease themselves out of the relegation zone with home games against Manchester United on Tuesday and West Ham at the weekend.

Celtic could face punishment over fans’ behaviour at Stranraer
~CONTENTS~
Celtic could face punishment over the behaviour of their supporters during the Scottish Cup match at Stranraer.The Scottish Football Association compliance officer, Tony McGlennan, has reviewed video footage of the travelling fans at Stair Park on Sunday that appears to show them letting off flares and singing offensive chants. A smoke bomb was also thrown on to the pitch during Celtic’s 3-0 win.If McGlennan decides any of rules have been breached he will write to both clubs to seek their views before passing the matter to a judicial panel, which would rule on the case and issue a sanction if necessary.The matter is still at an early stage but among the guidelines McGlennan will consult before taking his next step are SFA disciplinary rules 35 and 37 which govern the responsibility of clubs to ensure the good conduct and behaviour of supporters, whether at home or away.Penalties include fines, censures and an order forcing matches to be played behind closed doors.Ronny Deila warned Celtic fans they are risking the club’s reputation. Celtic have a Uefa charge pending after fans set off flares during their Europa League match at Fenerbahce in December, the latest of several charges for supporter incidents which have been punished by European football’s governing body in recent years.“We don’t want this. It’s something that is making a bad reputation for the club. So this is absolutely something we need to get stopped,” the Celtic manager said. “It is not positive for anybody and we, as a club, don’t want to have anything to do with this. Safety has to be the most important thing in every game we play.”

Louis van Gaal: Manchester United fans left early to escape the traffic

Louis van Gaal believes Manchester United supporters should be happy their team are through to the fourth round of the FA Cup and suggested that traffic around Old Trafford, rather than apathy, was one of the reasons why many supporters left before the end of the dull 1-0 win over Sheffield United.Thousands of fans streamed out of the stadium on Saturday before the end of the third-round tie, which United won thanks to a penalty three minutes into stoppage time from Wayne Rooney.United did not have a shot on target against the League One side until the 69th minute and were booed off at half-time. Van Gaal insists supporters should be happy with the way their team have returned to winning ways in recent weeks following a run of eight matches without victory.“You have to be happy as a Manchester United fan that we are in next round and we have won the last two games,” he said. When asked why many had left the stadium early, Van Gaal said: “They are not thinking that we would score, I think, and maybe also because of the traffic that they leave the stadium a few minutes early. There are many reasons.”“I think the fans have supported our team. It is not an easy time now. How many stadiums were like our stadium, full, I think? You can mention how they leave but you can also mention how they come to the stadium to watch this FA Cup match.”Paul Scholes tore into Van Gaal after the final whistle, claiming the players looked “bored”. Van Gaal refused to respond to the former United midfielder. “What do I have to do now? React to Paul Scholes? Do you want that?” he snapped back at journalists at his press conference to preview Tuesday’s match at Newcastle.Bastian Schweinsteiger is out of the game at St James’ Park because of a knee injury he sustained in the FA Cup win.Adnan Januzaj was pulled out of the Under-21 squad for Monday’s game at Reading because Van Gaal does not think he is fit enough. He recalled Januzaj from his loan at Borussia Dortmund last week but the manager told MUTV: “We have reconsidered and we think we have to build him up for the game and not risk too much by putting him in a game at once.”

Harry Kane says he is staying put at Tottenham Hotspur
~CONTENTS~
Harry Kane is aiming to fire Tottenham Hotspur to success in all competitions this season after dismissing the latest speculation linking him with a move away from White Hart Lane.The 22-year-old came off the bench on Sunday to score a last-gasp penalty and earn Spurs a 2-2 draw and an FA Cup third-round replay at Leicester next week.Mauricio Pochettino played down reports the England striker had emerged as a target for Real Madrid and Kane insists his future lies with Spurs. “Yes, definitely,” he replied when asked if Tottenham was where he wanted to spend his long-term future.“There are always going to be rumours flying around but I’m happy here. The club is in a good shape, we have a great future and I’m raring to go so we will see what happens.“We have got a lot of young players raring to go who are getting better and better with each game and that is all we have got to do. Keep working hard on the training field, we are getting better and more experienced the more we play and I think we can only get better.”Kane was one of seven changes made for the FA Cup tie, with Leicester making a swift return to White Hart Lane for a Premier League meeting on Wednesday.Pochettino is likely to welcome back the majority of those given a break on Sunday and Kane believes fourth-placed Spurs have enough to fight for honours across the board, even without strengthening in the transfer window.“We have got a very good squad,” he said. “You see here we made some changes and they came in and did very well. It is down to the manager what he wants to do in the transfer window, us as players just have to focus on each game that comes along and try to do our best.“That is what we will do and we have a busy period coming up now especially with the replay, so we have got to keep working hard. If the gaffer doesn’t want anyone in, we are happy to go and fight for places in the league and fight for the cup competitions.”

Mark Sampson has extended his contract as England Women’s head coach until 2019. The former Bristol Academy coach guided the Lionesses to third place at the World Cup in Canada last summer. The 33-year-old’s new deal will include the 2019 World Cup campaign which will take place in France.“I am delighted to have agreed to continue working with the Lionesses through to the 2019 Fifa Women’s World Cup,” he said. “It is an honour and a privilege to manage such a fantastic group of people who represent their country with incredible pride and passion.”Sampson was appointed in December 2013 and, as well as helping England to their best-ever World Cup finish in 2015, they now sit fifth in the world rankings – their highest-ever position.Mark Sampson’s tactics at World Cup propel him to Ballon d’Or awards Read moreEngland have also won both of their Euro 2017 qualifying games so far and look well set to feature in the tournament in the Netherlands next summer.Sampson, who is shortlisted for the Fifa Women’s World Coach of the Year at the Ballon d’Or awards in Zurich, added: “We have all worked very hard over the last two years to improve both individually and collectively and our World Cup bronze medal highlights the progress this team has made.“It was crucial post the World Cup that we worked hard to continue to grow the game and I am pleased, with the steps we have taken, we are ready to do just that.”The goalkeeping coach Lee Kendall has also agreed a two-year extension to his current deal.

Rémi Garde calls on Aston Villa owner Randy Lerner to speak to fans
~CONTENTS~
Rémi Garde hopes the Aston Villa owner, Randy Lerner, and the chief executive, Tom Fox, will break their silence soon and insists he understands fans’ anger after he and the players were abused.The manager said he has asked Lerner to talk to supporters with the club in disarray and fury spilling over as Villa prop up the Premier League.Aston Villa subject of crisis talks in New York after poor show at Wycombe Read moreGarde and his squad were abused as they boarded the coach after Saturday’s 1-1 FA Cup draw at Wycombe Wanderers, while Micah Richards spoke to supporters to calm tensions during the game.Lerner has barely spoken to the media in five years and Garde expects he and Fox, who has flown to New York to hold crisis talks with the owner, to address Villa’s situation.Garde said: “This is something I asked from them a fortnight ago, or something like that. Not to take the pressure off me – if I didn’t want the pressure I wouldn’t have this job. It’s more because I’m facing [the media] every week but I know Villa from inside for only 10 weeks now. At some point I cannot explain and I am not in the position to judge what happened before and whether it was right or wrong because I wasn’t here.“At some point it is important that the Aston Villa voice is not only mine. This is not to avoid my responsibilities. I will do it as long as I am in this position at this club.”Villa are at home to Crystal Palace on Tuesday and are 11 points from safety. They are seven points behind second-bottom Sunderland and tensions boiled over after Villa failed to beat League Two Wycombe.Videos of the manager and players being abused after the game at Wycombe were posted on social media while the substitutes Brad Guzan and Joleon Lescott were also accused of playing a game involving who could spit chewing gum the farthest during the match.Garde tried to move on from the weekend but conceded he expected the reaction. “I know football, in every country it’s the same. I understand completely the fans’ frustration. I am not surprised because I know that from situations from different clubs I have played and worked for.”He said he was not aware of the reported issue with Lescott and Guzan but reminded all players of their responsibilities. “As a professional player, you need to behave in the right way with respect for everybody. It doesn’t matter if you are top of the table or bottom. It’s just a question of being respectful to everybody.”Against Palace, Garde is without Carlos Sánchez and Alan Hutton (hamstrings) while Jack Grealish (tonsillitis) and Gabriel Agbonlahor (back) are doubtful.

Napoli's 'winter title' makes them serious contenders for Serie A glory
~~AUTHOR~~
Paolo Bandini
~CONTENTS~
Maurizio Sarri is not much one for birthdays. You could imagine him lighting a cigarette off the candles on a cake sooner than stopping to blow them out. But even he would concede that his 57th was a little bit special. He celebrated it by taking his childhood team back to the top of Serie A.Born in Naples, but raised in Tuscany, Sarri was the only Napoli supporter in his class at school and could hardly have imagined that he might one day wind up as their manager. Indeed, he might have struggled to believe in that scenario as recently as 2012, a year that he began without a job after being sacked by third-tier Sorrento. He certainly would have done so a decade earlier, back when he was still working for a bank.Sassuolo shock Serie A leaders Inter with last gasp penalty win Read moreEven today he sometimes talks like a man who might need to pinch himself to check that this is all real. Sunday’s 5-1 rout of Frosinone not only moved Napoli into first place but also made them Italy’s winter champions – a notional title awarded to the side that sits top of the table after half of the games have been played. Afterward, Sarri observed that: “When I signed, my only hope was to still be manager at this stage.”It was a joke, but laced with truth – as his gags so often are. Sarri is a man possessed of a wicked and dry sense of humour (commenter CalcioZucchini picked up on some entertaining recent lines just last week) that comes out often in his dealings with the press. On the eve of this game, one reporter had asked Sarri whether he still considered the word “Scudetto” to be “una bestemmia” – a swearword, as the manager had defined it while playing down his team’s title credentials through the first half of this season. “Yes it is,” replied Sarri in solemn tones. “But you know, I am a Tuscan, and where I come from we swear quite a bit.” Not even the most cautious Napoli supporter could exclude their side as a contender at this stage. The winter title might not hold any real value, but in recent years it has proved a surprisingly reliable predictor of future success: its last 12 winners have all gone on to finish the season as Serie A champions. Napoli themselves had not been winter champions for more than a quarter of a century. The last year in which they were, 1990, was the last time they won the league. That success was founded on the brilliance of Diego Maradona, a man quick to criticise Sarri’s appointment last September. The Argentinian had recanted his words and apologised by November, and on Sunday expressed his “great joy” at the club’s latest triumph. “Knowing that the city of Naples and my Neapolitan fans can celebrate today makes me even happier than them,” he said. “Now I want to win the league, come on lads!” It is not just the fact of Napoli’s victories, but the manner of them that has won sceptics like Maradona around. The Frosinone win represented the fifth time this season that the Partenopei have scored five goals in a single match. Several of this weekend’s efforts, and most notably the ones from Marek Hamsik and Manolo Gabbiadini, were really rather beautiful. Aesthetics alone will not win you a league title, but having the most prolific attack in the league, allied with the joint-second stingiest defence, will certainly take you a long way. It does not hurt to have a player like Gonzalo Higuaín up front, either. His two goals against Frosinone give him 18 in 19 league games this season. That puts him an extraordinary seven clear of second-placed Eder in Serie A’s scoring charts.Even so, Napoli did need some help to claim their winter title. They had begun the weekend behind Inter and level on points with Fiorentina in second place. Both of those teams had winnable home games, against Sassuolo and Lazio respectively; both found a way to lose. Fiorentina’s defeat was most surprising. Lazio arrived fresh from a home draw against Carpi and having won only a single league match – albeit in impressive fashion, away to Inter – since October. Flat and insipid for so much of this campaign, they served a reminder of the directness and pace that carried them to third last season as they swept to a deserved 3-1 victory at the Stadio Artemio Franchi. It was a different story at San Siro. Inter had beaten Sassuolo 7-0 in each of the past two seasons, but knew that the team facing them this time would be a different proposition. Sixth in the table at the start of the weekend, despite having played one game fewer than all of the sides around them, the Neroverdi had established themselves as a side to be reckoned with. They attacked Inter from the get-go, and their hosts responded in kind. On another day, this match might have led to five or six goals, but both keepers were in spectacular form. The save made by Sassuolo’s Andrea Consigli on the stroke of half-time, finding the strength in his wrist to push Adem Ljajic’s effort around the post at full-stretch, must go down as one of the best in Europe this season. Paolo Bandini (@Paolo_Bandini)Absolutely extraordinary save from Sassuolo's Andrea Consigli vs Inter at end of 1st half. Incredible reach: pic.twitter.com/Ba5XBnFa91January 10, 2016 Samir Handanovic made some vital interventions at the other end, too, but as the second-half progressed Inter appeared the more likely winners. Instead, they were sunk deep into injury time, Domenico Berardi converting from the penalty spot after Miranda bundled Gregoire Defrel to the floor.Andrea Poma (@andypoma87)Handanovic illegale! 😱 #InterSassuolo pic.twitter.com/k80ibAzOvHJanuary 10, 2016 For Sassuolo, this was further validation of an extraordinary season. They remain sixth but have now faced all five of the teams ahead of them and beaten or drawn with all of them. On a budget roughly one quarter the size of Serie A’s richest teams, Eusebio Di Francesco has built a side whose tempo and furious pressing game can make them a match for just about anybody. Sunday’s win reinforces the sense that they can sustain a European challenge. But they were not the only ones celebrating it. News of Berardi’s goal was met with a gleeful roar from the 2,000 or so Napoli fans who were gathering before kick-off in the away enclosure at Frosinone’s Stadio Matusa. There was no doubt a similar reaction among Juventus’s supporters all over the peninsula. That goal by Berardi – a player who the Bianconeri had part-owned until recently, and whom they still have an option to purchase outright in 2016 - paved the way for the reigning champions to climb up to joint-second in the table by beating Sampdoria on Sunday night. Not bad for a side that begun the campaign with five points from its opening six games. This was Juventus’s ninth consecutive win, and Sarri had identified them as enduring favourites for the Scudetto before it was even achieved. “Four league titles in four years,” observed the birthday boy. “That does not seem like a small thing to me.” Indeed not. But then, neither does Napoli’s first winter championship in 26 years.Talking points• This was not Maurizio Sarri’s birthday cake, but it should have been (In fact it was made by a Napoli fan club, named in his honour, near to his old hometown of Figline Valdarno at the end of last month.)• Another figure much beloved of Napoli’s supporters these days is Pepe Reina – who has won them over with his saves, his enthusiastic mid-game celebrations and genuine affection for the city that he now represents. As such, the mayor of Naples is now considering granting him honorary citizenship. “It’s a hypothesis, we’ve talked about it these last few days,” Luigi De Magistris told Radio Kiss Kiss. “Beyond being a great goalkeeper he is showing himself to be a defender of Naples and of Neapolitans.”• Perhaps the most charming story of the season so far arrives from Modena, where Lorenzo Pasciuti scored his first goal of the season for Carpi and in the process became the first player in Italian football history to score for the same team in all of the country’s top five divisions. He has been with the club since 2010, when they were still playing in Serie D, and played a prominent part in their rise from there to the top-flight. There were questions about whether he could cut it at this level, and he did not make his first top-flight appearance until November, but he has played well enough lately to carve out a role. “There were some people who said I couldn’t make it in the fourth division,” said Pasciuti. “But I won there just like I did in the third and the second. Someone then said that I couldn’t play in Serie A, but I give everything and today I’m happy with my goal.” Even happier, indeed, for the fact that it helped his team to a 2-1 win over Udinese.• Not even divine intervention could rescue Fiorentina against Lazio this weekend. Sister Daniela, the nun who has become a lucky mascot for the Viola in recent seasons, was spotted fleeing her seat after the visitors’ second goal went in.• Roma’s game against Milan on Saturday was supposed to decide the fate of at least one manager, with reports speculating that the loser would be fired and even Sinisa Mihajlovic likening their situation to that of two desperate pistoliers preparing for a decisive duel. It was probably inevitable, then, that the match should end in a draw that did not leave either side truly satisfied - although it is Rudi Garcia who now seems closest to the brink. Corriere dello Sport quoted him as saying he was “disgusted” with the result, and several outlets are reporting that Garcia will be replaced this week. • As frustrating as Roma have been lately, it should be noted that they are still only fifth, five points outside the Champions League places. Milan are another five points further back, and have now fallen behind the surging Empoli. Massimo Maccarone’s eighth goal of the campaign was enough to seal the Tuscans’ latest victory, away to Torino. They have now won five of their last six matches in Serie A.• Verona’s defeat at home to Palermo means that they have gone the entire first half of this season without a win. Already 11 points from safety, it is increasingly hard to see them charting a course to survival.Results: Atalanta 0-2 Genoa, Bologna 0-1 Chievo, Carpi 2-1 Udinese, Fiorentina 1-3 Lazio, Frosinone 1-5 Napoli, Inter 0-1 Sassuolo, Roma 1-1 Milan, Sampdoria 1-2 Juventus, Torino 0-1 Empoli, Verona 0-1 Palermo

Gary Cahill backs Ruben Loftus-Cheek to be Chelsea’s Dele Alli

~CONTENTS~
Gary Cahill has praised Ruben Loftus-Cheek for showing patience at Chelsea and, following his first goal for the club in Sunday’s 2-0 victory over Scunthorpe, has backed the midfielder to replicate the progress made by Dele Alli at Tottenham Hotspur.FA Cup: talking points from the third round Read moreLoftus-Cheek was the only Chelsea youth product involved in Guus Hiddink’s matchday squad and for some time has been the sole academy graduate who has appeared likely to break into the first-team. The 19-year-old was given his debut by José Mourinho in December 2014 but made only three subsequent league starts under the Portuguese. He was also only a substitute for the weekend’s FA Cup third-round tie, but having come on for Oscar at half-time and scored, Cahill believes Loftus-Cheek can now progress in his career at Stamford Bridge.“I’m delighted for him,” said Cahill. “With the quality in the team and especially in his position, he’s had to be patient. He’s worked really hard in training, he’s a great kid, he works really hard at his game. He’s been chomping at the bit and he wants to be involved, he wants to play. He’s shown that patience.“But it’s not just his goal, it was his performance. It was great. As a young boy, you just want to do everything right when you come on and especially when you come on at home, with the crowd here. You may not get too many opportunities when you are younger so to come on and do as well as he did. I’m really pleased for him.”Asked if Loftus-Cheek has the qualities to be Chelsea’s Alli – a young, English midfielder who firmly establishes himself at a leading Premier League club – Cahill added: “Ruben has had a couple of runs in the team and I think he is a top, top player. If you look at attributes, he’s got all the attributes. It’s just how he progresses. Obviously, that’s down to him getting a few chances and down to himself so it will be interesting to see how he does progress but for me, he has got everything that you need to become a top player. Dele Alli’s rise has been incredibly fast and why can’t he do it?”Loftus-Cheek also received praise from Kurt Zouma, Cahill’s defensive partner against Scunthorpe and a young player who has broken into the first-team. “I’m very happy for him because he works hard every day in training,” said the Frenchman. “You know that when you are young and you get a chance you have to give everything for that. He took his chance and he scored, so now he has to keep going. It’s not the end for him“The young guys, we know we have to wait, because the big players, older than us. But when we have a chance we have to give everything.”Cahill and Zouma both dismissed the significance of last week’s training ground row between Diego Costa and Oscar, with the England international saying: “I’ve seen it about a million times in training, it was absolutely nothing. They are best friends at the club.”

Arsène Wenger: Benik Afobe has the qualities to do well at Bournemouth

James Riach
~CONTENTS~
Arsène Wenger believes Benik Afobe is a shrewd signing for Bournemouth, saying the striker’s £9m fee is not excessive even though he was let go by Arsenal in January 2015.Afobe has signed a four-and-a-half year contract at Bournemouth, with Eddie Howe opting to add the forward to his squad following a series of long-term injuries sustained by his attacking players this season. The 22-year-old scored 23 goals in 48 games for Wolves and is Bournemouth’s record signing.FA Cup: talking points from the third round Read more“He has the qualities to integrate into a team like Bournemouth, whose game is based on movement, pace and quick football,” said Wenger. “I must say I am very happy for Benik because he had an outstanding attitude here and I am very pleased he has done well.“It is a good opportunity for him and I hope he will be successful there. Sometimes you have to let people go who are not completely ready for us, knowing that they could be successful. I am very happy because we have contributed to his success and I hope he will have a long, good career.“I believe it’s a normal price for a player who wants to play in the Premier League as a striker, it is not excessive. He has scored goals in the lower leagues and the risk is not massive considering Bournemouth will take advantage of the extra [TV] money that will come in at the end of the season.”Wenger said he expected a busy transfer window for Premier League clubs, especially those attempting to avoid relegation. “At the bottom and at the top, everyone thinks they have a responsibility to do something because we have a chance if we do improve our squad,” said Wenger. “At the bottom, especially with the new TV deal coming in, the teams fearing to go down will be under pressure not to accept the situation.”Arsenal play Liverpool at Anfield on Wednesday night, the first time that Wenger and Jürgen Klopp have met in English football. Mesut Özil and Mathieu Flamini are expected to return for Arsenal, while Alexis Sánchez could return for Arsenal’s following match against Stoke at the weekend.Meanwhile. Wenger is expecting Mohamed Elneny to complete his move to the club this week, saying: “We are positive this week that it can happen. The situation should be sorted out this week as there are a lot of work permit problems as well and special paperwork to do. We hope we can finalise it this week.”

Lionel Messi to be rested by Argentina for summer Olympics

The Argentina coach Gerardo Martino has said he will rest Lionel Messi for the summer Olympics in Rio. He believes that calling up the Barcelona forward could risk burning him out, particularly as Messi is due to play in the centenary edition of the Copa América in the United States this summer.“Exposing Leo by using him in another competition after all the football he’s played would be overkill, in my opinion. It would come back to haunt us in terms of what we have in store in the second half of the year”, Martino told the Argentinian paper Clarín.“Common sense dictates that he and other players in his position should only feature in the Copa América,” he added, although he admitted to not having discussed the subject with Messi.“Considering the amount of football in their legs, because many of our most important players reach the latter stages of international competitions having played a lot of games, I think it’s only logical to take the weight of having to play in both the Copa América and the Olympics off their shoulders.“I see it as more important for them to be in good shape for World Cup qualifying, for them to be able to spend pre-season with their clubs and have a break after the Copa América,” he said.

Mathieu Valbuena has said he would have “no problem” playing alongside Karim Benzema should they both be chosen to play for France in the Euros.Benzema, who is under formal investigation in connection with an alleged attempt to blackmail his international team-mate, is currently suspended from the national team while the case is being resolved.The Real Madrid striker had asked the French federation to delay making any decision before Euro 2016 which takes place in France. He is under judicial control, meaning he is not allowed to have any contact with Valbuena.Euro 2016: Michael Cox’s group by group guide Read moreValbuena, whose own place is under threat after he was left out of Didier Deschamps’ squad, along with Benzema, to play Germany and England in November, told French television’s TF1 he would be happy to play alongside the striker: “We will see how it goes, but yes, no problem, anything is possible. It wasn’t like it was a murder.”The midfielder said he was confident that he would still take part in the Euros. “The Euros have been our objective for the last two years. We are preparing for them and I don’t imagine myself for a second not being involved.“There is no guarantee. I have had a chat with the coach but I am not going to discuss what was said. We talked about a lot of things that made me feel better.”Benzema had requested a face-to-face meeting with Valbuena, with his lawyers hoping a meeting would ease tensions between the players, but that request was turned down last week by the investigating judge in charge of the case.Benzema is being investigated over an alleged attempt by one of his friends to extort money from Valbuena over a sex tape. He told investigators he approached Valbuena about the tape on behalf of “a childhood friend” but claims he did not think he was doing anything wrong.His lawyer has insisted he was not party to any blackmail attempt. “He played no part, I repeat no part, in any blackmail or attempted blackmail,” Sylvain Cormier, Benzema’s lawyer, said in November.The European Championship begins in France on 10 June.

FA Cup: talking points from the third round

Guardian sport
~CONTENTS~
1) Bellerín shines brightly as one of Arsenal’s starsWhen Arsène Wenger was asked after Arsenal’s 3-1 win against Sunderland if there was a better right-back than Héctor Bellerín in England he could not help laughing a little. “I don’t know,” Wenger said, clearly wishing the question could simply go away, before adding: “Look at the numbers, defensive and offensive, the fact he’s only 20 years old.” Wenger had just finished talking up Alex Iwobi’s contribution after a promising half-hour from an occasional team-mate of Bellerín’s in the development levels, valuable praise for a young player in need of reinforcement. With Bellerín the opposite is true. That laugh was Wenger initiating the reverse thrusters and taking an alternative path. Some might suggest the only real countdown now is how many seasons Wenger can hang on to him before the lure of one of Europe’s super clubs, perhaps a return to Catalonia, becomes irresistible. For now Bellerín seems to have it all: poise, craft, the athleticism and intelligence to cover his own mistakes and real creativity going forward, as he showed with two decisive surges to make Arsenal’s winning goals. Already his emergence has rearranged the careers of a few players around him. Mathieu Debuchy may well be off. Calum Chambers, who might have expected some time at right-back, is now popping up in central defensive midfield. Barney Ronay    Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest  Arsène Wenger reacts following the third-round FA Cup tie victory against Sunderland.• Giroud puts seal on Arsenal’s Cup win against Sunderland2) Oxford feed off success on several fronts Oxford United are embroiled in an intense battle for promotion from League Two and on Thursday they begin duelling with Millwall for a place in the Johnstone Paint Trophy final at Wembley. So they could have invoked plenty of excuses for playing below par against Swansea. Instead they tore into their Premier League visitors, outworking them and outplaying them, with the Welsh team’s interim manager, Alan Curtis, admitting: “Our players couldn’t cope”. It was a glorious win. On this evidence Oxford belong at a higher level (and MK Dons must have some excellent right-backs if they can afford to send George Baldock out on loan). Swansea, for years an inspiration for the likes of Oxford, need to improve hugely and quickly if they are to avoid slipping back down a level. It must alarm the Welsh club’s fans that some of the players who start often in the Premier League were among their worst performers at Oxford. Paul Doyle • Roofe falls in for Swansea in defeat at Oxford3) Tottenham fail to make most of Trippier’s strengthsMark Sampson’s tactics at World Cup propel him to Ballon d’Or awards Read moreKieran Trippier was, alongside Danny Ings, Burnley’s leading assist-maker last season and took that honour by a distance the previous season when he set up 12 goals as they won the Championship title. Over several seasons his crossing has been excellent in open play and more dangerous still from set pieces, and he has one assist from one league start this campaign, his centre having been cleverly turned in by Son Heung-min at Watford on 28 December. It was, therefore, surprising to see Spurs focus so many of their attacks down the left flank against Leicester where, for all that he earned the match-saving penalty, Danny Rose’s delivery is far less reliable. With Nacer Chadli starting on the left of a front three and Josh Onomah, theoretically on the right of that group, often floating across the field to join him, Trippier was frequently left isolated on the opposite flank. It was tempting to wonder how many corners Christian Eriksen would be allowed to waste before Trippier was called in to take one in his stead – a question to which the answer was sadly never found. Mauricio Pochettino cannot be expected to plan his tactics round a player whom he selects so infrequently but neither does it seem sensible not to utilise his best attributes. Simon Burnton• Harry Kane spot-on to earn replay for Spurs 4) Walters is a one-off for the one-offsJonathan Walters enhanced his reputation as a Cup specialist extraordinaire with Stoke’s stunning winner at League One’s Doncaster. The 25-yard drive at the Keepmoat Stadium was his 19th goal for the club in knockout football in only his 30th full appearance. Add his brace that earned the Republic of Ireland a two-legged victory over Bosnia in the Euro 2016 play-offs last October and Walters’ ability to rise to the one-off occasion is given further credence. “Jon seems to score every time we play in the cups,” said Stoke’s manager, Mark Hughes. So, although his record of 37 Premier League goals in 191 matches for Stoke is more reflective of his career productivity, Hughes may consider pitching the 32-year-old into the Capital One Cup second leg at Anfield a fortnight on Tuesday where the visitors will be looking to overturn a 1-0 semi-final deficit. Richard Gibson• Stoke class tells at Doncaster thanks to Walters’ Cup special5) Are lower-league clubs now dismissing the Cup too?      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Dagenham & Redbridge showed little ambition at Goodison Park. Photograph: TGSPhoto/REX/ShutterstockWorryingly, and somewhat inevitably, the days when only Premier League clubs could be accused of treating the FA Cup third round as an inconvenient distraction are ending. On the evidence of Dagenham & Redbridge’s approach to their 2-0 defeat at Everton, an outlook that poses a genuine threat to the competition’s reputation is now shared in League Two. It is harsh to condemn the visitors’ performance at Goodison Park. They are 22nd in their division and started with two loanees who had never trained with their team-mates against an Everton side fielding eight changes from their Capital One Cup semi-final win over Manchester City. But their ambition – or complete lack of it – was depressing. The money was in the bank from a third-round tie that attracted almost 31,000 to Goodison but, as the manager, John Still, admitted afterwards, Dagenham & Redbridge’s game plan was simply to avoid a heavy defeat that would impact on morale. The veteran manager said: “I think it is becoming more difficult. I think your best chance is at home on not the best pitch. To play in the Premier League now you have to be the best players in the world and in Europe. So that makes it more difficult to get shocks. You can’t affect what they do. You can affect what you do and I think that’s what we did today.” Andy Hunter• Saturday Sundae: Goodison Cat v Anfield Cat• Mirallas and Koné ease Everton past Dagenham & Redbridge6) Adkins provides reminder of his talent against Manchester UnitedThe way Sheffield United were set up and carried out Nigel Adkins’ instructions at Old Trafford on Saturday was evidence of his abilities as a manager. Only a late, late Wayne Rooney penalty knocked the Blades out of the FA Cup as the visitors stifled Manchester United throughout. It was Adkins’ first visit to the famous stadium, a reminder of his premature sacking in January 2013 when leading Southampton in the Premier League. December’s League One Manager of the Month gong is a happier pointer regarding Adkins’ talents. His United side are ninth after winning four of their last five outings. Now 50, it is not too late for Akdins to rise again in the crazy cabaret that is English football management.

But we are not talking about Oscar and Diego Costa, “the participants in the high-profile bust-up”, rather Nemanja Matic, who was left out of the squad after taking a blow during training on Saturday. According to Guus Hiddink, Matic was injured when one of the goalkeepers hurled the ball out and it struck him on the back of the head. “He was a little dizzy and is still a bit dizzy,” Hiddink said after the 2-0 win over Scunthorpe. Matic missed out, having been dropped at Crystal Palace the previous Sunday. Hiddink has made it clear he prizes the balance that Mikel John Obi brings to the team and, having been an unused substitute against Scunthorpe, the Nigerian, rather abruptly, appeared to enjoy “rested-star-against-cup-minnow” status. What is also plain is that Matic faces a fight to regain his starting place. He was arguably the player of the first half of last season and his fall from form and favour has been remarkable. David Hytner• Loftus-Cheek helps Chelsea see off Scunthorpe8) Iheanacho begins to shine at Manchester CityMany Manchester City supporters have been keen to see more of Kelechi Iheanacho, if necessary at the expense of Wilfried Bony, and against Norwich the 19-year-old demonstrated he is a very genuine striking option for Manuel Pellegrini, either starting or from the bench. Strong and aware, Iheanacho appears to be an instinctive and precise finisher with a maturity that belies his youth, and what was also evident on Saturday was that his team-mates trust him with the ball. With Sergio Agüero almost back to his best, the emergence of Iheanacho as both a foil for the brilliant Argentinian and a goal-scorer in his own right could be crucial as City pursue success in four competitions.

Hendrik Almstadt, the club’s sporting director, will be on the same plane and the talks will revolve around trying to bring in some new signings for Rémi Garde. Yet Villa’s problems are so extensive it is difficult to think that a flurry of transfers is going to put everything right. And, besides, how easy will it be to bring in high-quality players when Villa are near-certainties for relegation? They finished this tie against the sixth-placed side from League Two with many away fans turning on their own players and Garde targeted for chants of “You don’t know what you’re doing”. Lerner might approve a period of emergency spending but Villa have made such a pig’s ear of their previous transfer business it is not easy to imagine that three of the people responsible for the club being in this mess will suddenly be able to put everything right. Daniel Taylor 10) Newcastle must buy a striker      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Steve McClaren holds his head after another wasted opportunity at Vicarage Road. Photograph: Peter Cziborra/ReutersNewcastle have lost four successive matches 1-0. They have scored 19 goals in the Premier League this season and, although they dominated against Watford, their lack of confidence in attack was evident once again.Aleksandar Mitrovic has scored three goals since joining the club last summer while Papiss Cissé has been frustrated by injury. Steve McClaren’s side have not scored since 19 December. McClaren would not comment on whether a new forward would be drafted in this January but there is no question Newcastle need one. Charlie Austin, Saido Berahino and the Napoli forward Manolo Gabbiadini have all been linked with a move this month. Newcastle’s performance at Vicarage Road surely increases concerns at the club before Tuesday’s home match against Manchester United. James Riach• Deeney pounces to put wasteful Newcastle out of FA Cup11) Hindsight is a wonderful thingRemember Michael Woods? There was an awful fuss when Chelsea were accused of poaching him from Leeds United’s academy a decade ago. Woods never made it at Stamford Bridge and has since spent a few years knocking around the lower divisions – at one point dropping into non-league football with Harrogate Town. He is back in League Two now, playing for struggling Hartlepool and in Saturday’s defeat by Derby County Woods looked the best player on the pitch. At 25 there is still time for this clearly talented midfielder to clamber back up the pyramid. But what might have been had he stayed at Leeds rather than being lured by Chelsea into what turned out to be a wrong turn? You wonder how Darren Bent's career would have panned out had he stayed at the Stadium of Light Then there is Darren Bent. He rarely starts for Derby these days but he scored their late winner at Victoria Park. It was the 200th goal of Bent’s club career. Reaching a double century is a considerable achievement for any striker but it is worth noting that five years ago, just before the one-time England forward’s £18m transfer from Sunderland to Aston Villa, he had already reached 157 goals. Since leaving Wearside in January 2011 he has taken his time to reach 200 with things swiftly going wrong at Villa and now proving frustrating at Derby. The days when Bent rattled in 36 goals in 63 games for Sunderland are long gone and one wonders how his career might have panned out had he stayed at the Stadium of Light. The move earned Bent – and Sunderland – a lot of money but it was to cost both parties dear. Louise Taylor• Bent destroys Hartlepool dream with late winner12) Exeter’s welcome for Liverpool was commendable Teams are often accused of lacking respect for their opponents, usually around this time of year, and eyebrows were raised about Jürgen Klopp’s unfamiliar Liverpool line-up at St James Park, even taking his extensive injury list into consideration. Many thought it would be no great surprise if League Two Exeter won when news of Klopp’s team had filtered through. But Exeter, as a club, showed total respect for their opponents, including a message for away fans on the turnstiles. “Thank you for travelling 252 miles to support your club today,” it read. The players respected Liverpool without ever finding themselves too deep in awe of the opposition. “I think years ago Clint [Clinton Morrison] said he played against Manchester United and Gerard Piqué played and nobody wanted his shirt, because nobody knew who he was on the night,” said the Exeter defender Jordan Tillson. “I think whenever you play against Liverpool you expect them to be the best players.” Ben Fisher• Match report: Exeter 2-2 Liverpool• Klopp to pick callow Liverpool side again for Exeter Cup replay• Liverpool struggle to find right wavelength after warm Exeter reception13) Questions over Carroll begin to grow stale       Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Andy Carroll, the big English striker, dominates discussion whenever he turns out for West Ham. Photograph: James Griffiths/West Ham United via Getty ImagesEvery time Andy Carroll makes an impact for West Ham Slaven Bilic is asked the same series of questions. It usually begins with: “How important is it that he stays fit?” Bilic rattles off the answer we have heard so many times before and it is invariably followed by: “Does he need to change his game to keep fit?” When that was directed his way after Saturday’s dull 1-0 win, in which Carroll provided the assist for Nikica Jelavic, Bilic had had enough. The manager justifiably complained about being asked the same thing every week and instead of answering once more, said his response remains the same. But what are the odds on him being asked again on Tuesday if his big English striker – three words that encapsulate why this fascination persists – plays a key role at Bournemouth? Pretty low. Alan Smith• Jelavic scores late for West Ham to defeat Wolves on dismal day14) Poor scheduling is harming the FA CupSeldom have those who schedule the football fixtures so tested the enduring appeal of the FA Cup. Not only is there a full programme of league games this week but the next round also precedes an entire slab of Premier League fixtures. No wonder Eddie Howe, the Bournemouth manager, promised to continue rotating his team after making 11 changes on Saturday. And he made no apologies for indicating he will do the same again before his club’s league game at Crystal Palace on 2 February, after the fourth round. “If the FA Cup wants to be considered the best cup competition in the world, and keep its standing in English football, I’m not sure that is the wisest thing to do,” Howe said. Premier League survival is too important and too lucrative for a manager of any medium-sized or small club to risk injury or fatigue in a Cup game three days before a league game. The top-flight sides that rotated the least on Saturday included West Ham United, Manchester United, Manchester City and Arsenal, all of whom are effectively assured of Premier League football next season. Unless the FA wants to increase the Cup winners’ jackpot – Arsenal earned £4.2m from their successful 2014 run, enough to buy nearly half of Benik Afobe – to a parallel amount to Premier League riches, or a Champions League place can be offered, then the FA Cup will continue to fall into the shadows for clubs from the top two divisions.

Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   A groundsman brushes away the water as the referee, Iain Williamson, does his third pitch inspection before allowing the game at the Silverlake Stadium to go ahead. Photograph: Shaun Boggust/Colorsport/CorbisFollowing Bolton’s 1-1 draw at Eastleigh, Neil Lennon did not hide his feelings about the pitch. “One of the worst I’ve ever seen and I’ve seen some crackers in Scotland,” he said. “I wasn’t overly enamoured with it.” That could be deemed sour grapes, yet given the mud-drenched surface Lennon’s criticism was not outlandish and it is fair to ask if the match should have gone ahead. It took the referee, Iain Williamson, three pitch inspections to give the go-ahead and it is possible there were severe doubts on his part even at 1.15pm, less than two hours before kick-off, when he carried out the last of his checks. For sure Williamson would have been criticised if he had then called the match off given the vast majority of Bolton’s 1,000-plus supporters had made their way to Hampshire – they could have demanded a refund for ticket, petrol, food and other expenses had they arrived at the Silverlink Stadium only to be told there would be nothing to see. Which raises the question of how late decisions regarding pitch inspections should be made. According to Football Association rules – Rule 13(c) to be precise - “A referee shall whenever possible examine the ground and decide as to its fitness for play in sufficient time to save the expense of unnecessary journeys being incurred by clubs”. But is that not too vague? Should there not be a precise cut-off time so everyone, and travelling fans in particular, knows whether to continue or turn back for home? Sachin Nakrani • Eastleigh denied Cup glory by Bolton’s Darren Pratley but earn replay16) And talking of pitches … Sheridan let himself downJohn Sheridan raised eyebrows by criticising his club, Newport, after the tie with Blackburn was postponed due to heavy rain at their Rodney Parade ground. “I think we should have done our best to get the game definitely on, and I don’t think we did,” Sheridan said. “People were telling me it was the biggest game for 30 years and I felt that, if we had covered the pitch, we’d have got it started.” Nobody present disagreed with the decision to call the game off at 2pm. Puddles had formed on a pitch that had been unplayable for the match against Hartlepool the week before. “Groundstaff are extremely disappointed at his comments, very very unprofessional,” tweeted the Rodney Parade head of operations, Mark Jones, who later accepted an apology from Sheridan. As Jones pointed out, dome covers cost a significant five-figure sum and this would be a sizeable outlay for one of the league’s smallest clubs, who share their pitch with two rugby teams. The frustration was clear but managers are not always tuned into the logistics it takes to get a game on and on this occasion Sheridan would have been best advised to keep his mouth shut.

Photograph: Andrew Matthews/PAThis is a very big week for Southampton. Throughout their recent, dismal run of form – only one win in 10 – there has been a familiar pattern. They dominate games for long spells but fail to take their chances and it is interesting to note how agitated the usually placid Ronald Koeman is growing with each passing week. He cannot put his finger on the root cause of the slump but is increasingly aware the confidence of his players is fragile. He has already warned they are not safe from being dragged into a relegation fight and how badly they need to win against Watford and West Bromwich Albion at home this week to stave off those fears.

Football transfer rumours: Carlos Bacca and Alex Teixeira to Chelsea?
~~AUTHOR~~
Barry Glendenning
~CONTENTS~
Seville-based sports daily Estadio Deportivo reports that their local club’s former striker Carlos Bacca could be on his way from AC Milan to Chelsea for £30m. No relation to topical Kashyyyk-born Wookiee Chewbacca, the 29-year-old has scored 10 goals in 26 appearances for the Rossoneri this season following his move from Sevilla, for whom he scored seven goals, including two in the final, in last year’s successful Europa League defence. Chelsea are also understood to have offered Shakhtar Donetsk £26m for their midfielder Alex Teixeira.Fresh from his side’s FA Cup embarrassment at the hands of Oxford United at the Kassam Stadium yesterday, Jonjo Shelvey could leap from the frying pan into the fire by moving to Newcastle United for £10m. Having struggled to nail down a first team place at Swansea after an excellent start to the season, Shelvey is reported to be keen on a move from the Welsh strugglers and it doesn’t exactly sound as if his manager Alan Curtis will stand in his way.“We all know his ability, everybody can see it,” said Curtis last week. “His last game he was disappointing and he is far better than that. I’ve tried to speak to him and his attitude has always been in question, but he just wants to play and he gets frustrated if he is not in the team.”Following his red card against the Swans in September, Swiss midfielder Valon Behrami has not made a single start for Watford and could be headed for the Vicarage Road door marked “Do One”. Italian side Udinese, also owned by Watford sugar daddy Gino Pozzo, are interested in taking the 30-year-old on board. On loan at Watford from Chinese club Guangzhou Evergrande, Alessandro Diamanti’s time at Vicarage Road also looks to be drawing to a close, with Udinese, Bologna and Livorno all being touted as likely destinations for the former West Ham striker.Aston Villa suits Tom Fox, Paddy Riley and Hendrik Almstadt are on their way to the USA to plead with club owner Randy Lerner for funds to bring new faces to the Championship-bound side. Arsenal right-back Mathieu Debuchy is believed to feature prominently on their shopping list. Meanwhile at QPR, Brazilian midfielder Sandro will be bidding farewell to Loftus Road and returning home if Cruzeiro get their way.Newcastle have joined Liverpool and Tottenham Hotspur in the unseemly jostle to attract the attention of terminally unsettled West Brom striker Saido Berahino, while none too prolific former Hull City striker Dame N’Doye is being linked with a move from Turkish club Trabzonspor to Sunderland.With Steven Naismith heading for Norwich City, Everton will replace their Scottish winger with his 26-year-old Dynamo Kiev counterpart Andriy Yarmolenko, who will set them back £21m. Across Stanley Park, Liverpool are believed to have wrapped up an £11m deal for Corinthians’ Brazilian striker Alexandre “The Duck” Pato.And finally, back to Seville. Tottenham Hotspur are ready to cut their losses on Federico Fazio by selling the Argentinian defender back to Sevilla a little over a year after recruiting him from the La Liga side.

Real Betis sack Pepe Mel after eight games without a win

Real Betis have sacked Pepe Mel after more than a month without a win left the Seville-based club hovering just above the La Liga relegation places.“The board of Real Betis has decided tonight to sack [Pepe Mel] as coach of the club’s first team,” Betis said in a statement on their website.They did not immediately name a successor but said the president, Juan Carlos Ollero, and the sporting director, Eduardo Macía, would hold a news conference later.Mel, who has also coached Getafe, Rayo Vallecano and West Bromwich Albion, was appointed Betis coach for a second time in December 2014 and led them to promotion by winning the second division.They last won in La Liga at the end of November and Saturday’s 1-0 defeat at Getafe, their eighth outing without a victory in all competitions, left them in 15th place, five points above the drop zone.Their next game is Tuesday’s King’s Cup last-16 second leg at their city rivals Sevilla. They lost the first leg 2-0.

Louis van Gaal blames Manchester United players for Newcastle draw
~~AUTHOR~~
Louise Taylor
~CONTENTS~
It was a case of one step forward and two steps back for Manchester United and Louis van Gaal as they cast off their recent “boring” image on Tyneside on Tuesday night but, despite some thrilling attacking, dropped to sixth place in the Premier League.“Of course it feels like a defeat … we are very disappointed, we’ve lost very expensive points,” he said after his side’s 3-3 draw at Newcastle United where, despite Wayne Rooney scoring twice and creating another goal for Jesse Lingard, the visitors could not hold on to their leads.“We have only ourselves to blame because we could have won this match,” said Manchester United’s manager. “We missed big chances to win it. We were the better team. We have scored three goals but only have one point. So now is the defence weak? No. We were unlucky in decisions of the referee and a deflected shot and we did not finish our chances.”Paul Scholes: Manchester United performance at Newcastle ‘loads better’ Read moreThe Dutchman was unhappy with the award of a penalty to Newcastle, for shirt-pulling by Chris Smalling on Aleksandar Mitrovic, that made it 2-2, but put the blame on his own players. “We have given it away. I have told that to my players. When the referee gives a penalty for nothing – it is a duel I think and you cannot decide who is worse – but we gave it away.”While Paul Dummett’s late Newcastle equaliser took a hefty deflection off Smalling, Steve McClaren arguably had considerably greater cause to be aggrieved by the refereeing and strongly disagreed with the early handball penalty awarded against Chancel Mbemba from which Rooney opened the scoring.Van Gaal gave credit to Newcastle’s approach.“Newcastle only wanted to attack,” he said. “You see two teams who want to attack. We saw a fantastic game tonight.” He added that normally it was different and his side were the victims of opposition spoiling tactics. “Only one team [Manchester United’s opponents] wants to waste time and frustrate opponents,” he claimed.Relieved to have ended a run of four defeats, McClaren’s mood was further buoyed by the completion of Jonjo Shelvey’s £12m transfer from Swansea City shortly before kickoff. McClaren said: “I think there’s a lot more to come from him.” The midfielder is expected to make his debut at home to West Ham United on Saturday.“I’m delighted to have signed Jonjo Shelvey,” he said. “I tried to sign him last summer. He’s English, he’s in the England team and I think there’s a lot more to come from him.” He feels much the same about his team as a whole. “Manchester United are a quality team but at the end of the night we’ve shown what we’re all about,” said McClaren. “We’ve shown character, attitude. By the end we actually had more possession that Manchester United.”

Paul Scholes: Manchester United performance at Newcastle ‘loads better’
~CONTENTS~
Paul Scholes described Manchester United’s performance against Newcastle as “loads better” after watching Louis van Gaal’s side draw 3-3 at St James’ Park.The former England midfielder’s assessment of his former club was scathing after they only just edged past third-tier Sheffield United in Saturday’s FA Cup third-round tie at Old Trafford.A clearly frustrated and emotional Scholes said United’s players looked bored after a 1-0 Cup win that “was not good enough”.Van Gaal’s men were unable to follow that up with another victory on Tuesday, but the entertaining 3-3 draw at Newcastle left Scholes feeling much more positive.“Loads better,” he told BT Sport. “To go and watch Manchester United, whether it’s home or away, is entertainment, it’s goals – whether you concede goals or whether you can score goals.“Tonight that was like watching a Manchester United team. OK, they didn’t win but they should have won, really. [Marouane] Fellaini’s header – what a chance to make it 4-2 – and Jesse [Lingard] has had a great chance, and that’s just what I expect.“I expect positive play from Manchester United all the time, whether you’re at home or away. Sometimes it’s a little bit easier to do it away from home, actually, when a team comes out at you and really has a go like Newcastle did. Now they have to try and transfer this type of form to Old Trafford.”

Jürgen Klopp tells his players they have until May to prove themselves

~CONTENTS~
Jürgen Klopp has told Liverpool’s players they will be judged on a season-by-season basis but admitted he is also under pressure to develop a winning style this season.Liverpool host Arsenal on Wednesday 12 points behind the Premier League leaders and with their new loan signing Steven Caulker in line to play in central defence should Mamadou Sakho fail to recover from a knee injury.Kolo Touré: Jürgen Klopp knows I’m a fighter for Liverpool before myself Read moreKlopp has said repeatedly that Liverpool do not require an overhaul of their playing staff in the January transfer window, moving for Caulker only in response to his recent injury crisis. But he admits players have until the end of the season to prove they should feature in his long-term plans.“There is pressure on all of us but it’s not the time or the moment to think of it,” the Liverpool manager said. “I feel pressure before each game and between them, of course, but only to develop and improve as quickly as possible. I have to accept the situation. I don’t know which is our best game. I think: ‘Let’s recover for three days, on the fourth and fifth days train, sixth play again and take the next step.’ But that’s a dream world. You have to react in a normal one. For the players it’s the same.“I always say with players that I don’t sign contracts but it’s a contract for one year – a very good season the player can leave, a very bad one and the club will let the player leave. Anything can happen. In this year we are only focused on trying everything to make a season that when we are old and grey we can look back and say it was really worth it, that we found new friends, had success, all those things. It’s an agreement. You have to try things. Pressure is there but the art is only to feel the pressure to win games.“Now we have a new chance against Arsenal, a really good team, but we have weapons to be a real opponent in this game. What more could you want? One of [the] best teams in world, one of [the] best in the Premier League for sure and we can battle them, we can beat them. That’s what we want, we don’t think about the rest of the season, only this.”Simon Mignolet has agreed in principle a new contract with Liverpool that will tie him to the club until 2021. Talks on the five-year deal began before Christmas with Klopp keen to retain the goalkeeper who has attracted criticism for several errors yet kept more Premier League clean sheets in 2015 than any of his rivals.Mignolet is expected to put pen to paper on the new contract soon.

Kolo Touré: Jürgen Klopp knows I’m a fighter for Liverpool before myself
~~AUTHOR~~
Andy Hunter
~CONTENTS~
Kolo Touré dissolves into laughter, something he does with endearing regularity, when recalling how he joined Liverpool’s casualty list by throwing himself headfirst in front of a Xherdan Shaqiri cross at the Britannia Stadium. “José Enrique called it ‘The salmon tackle’,” the 34-year-old says. “I am very proud of this. It’s something I have brought to football! I give everything for my team to win but the most important thing is to enjoy every second of every minute. Football is great, isn’t it?” Cue more cackles.It is easy to understand Touré’s popularity in the Anfield dressing room when a discussion about suffering cramp against Stoke City sparks such amusement. Behind the jovial demeanour there remains an experienced, title-winning defender determined to prove his worth to Jürgen Klopp and one who, as a resolute display in the Capital One Cup semi-final win demonstrated, retains the ability to do so when opportunity arises at Liverpool.Another start will come his way against Arsenal on Wednesday when Steven Caulker could line up alongside Touré should Mamadou Sakho fail to recover from a knee problem. The salmon tackle, which resulted in the veteran missing the FA Cup third round trip to Exeter City, shows Caulker and others the standard required – in its peculiar way.Liverpool complete loan move for QPR defender Steven Caulker Read more“That is the mentality you need to have as a defender; when you are a defender at a top club every challenge is so important,” says Touré of the challenge that left him limping through the 1-0 win at Stoke. “That’s why you play for the best club. If I have to make this tackle again I will make it. That was my time to show I can still produce for my team and for me as well.“I had to stay on. You don’t want to give up and leave your team on their own at this time in a game. We had so many injuries and players going out, too, but to be honest it was only cramp. I managed to finish the game as a striker, which is not too bad.“Afterwards the manager took a picture of me in the ice bath and made a few jokes. He knows I’m a fighter and that, whenever he needs me, I will step in and give my best for the team. I’m playing for one of the best clubs in the world at 34. Not many players can say that. I enjoy every minute and I am proud to be in this squad of players.”Klopp has claimed Liverpool cannot hope to beat Arsenal by replicating their possession game at Anfield but Touré believes there are similarities between his new and old managers. “The training we do is very similar to Arsenal,” he says. “They [Klopp and Arsène Wenger] have the same approach in terms of the speed of the game, the togetherness – a lot of passing, technically they like to have good players on the ball and the intensity of both their teams is amazing.”The former Ivory Coast international’s admiration for Wenger remains clear. Touré spent seven years at Arsenal before leaving for Manchester City in 2009 and believes their manager deserves immense credit for guiding the Gunners to the Premier League summit, having sacrificed big names and big wages during the move to the Emirates Stadium.“When they started the new stadium everything changed,” said the defender, one of Arsenal’s Invincibles in 2003-04. “They needed to sell some players, cut the wage bill and they lost so many experienced players and leaders but Wenger has shown what a top manager he is. The thing I like is this manager can make an average player one of the best players in the world. He did that with so many players. Patrick Vieira was in Milan but not playing a lot, Thierry Henry was a winger at Juventus and he made him one of the best players in the world. I started from nowhere and he took me to the next level and I always respect him for that.”Arsenal were top when they visited Anfield in February 2014 but, not for the first time, lost their way following a 5-1 rout that ranked among Liverpool’s finest performances under Brendan Rodgers. Touré, Simon Mignolet and Jordan Henderson are likely to be the only survivors from that team who start on Wednesday because of departures and Liverpool’s injury problems. The defender does not anticipate a repeat from his former club.Touré says: “They will be worried about what happened a few years ago and will be much more focused from the first whistle. The 5-1 they didn’t start quite well and it was only during the game they realised how strong we were and that we could break any team. For sure, with what we have shown against City and Chelsea this season, I think they will come this time with more caution.”The 34-year-old’s defensive duties are not limited to Arsenal. Yaya Touré’s furious response to not winning the African player of the year award for a fifth year in succession prompts a determined rearguard action from his older brother. Naturally Kolo also sees the funny side of last week’s controversy in Nigeria. “I haven’t spoken to him yet, I think he would be angry with me as well,” laughs the Liverpool centre-half. “I need to teach Yaya how to speak a bit more.”Touré adds: “Yaya is a good player but some of the big players like Eric Cantona are very strong-willed. I think that is how he is. He is a winner and, when he doesn’t win everything, goes a little bit crazy. For me he deserved that award. He was the only African player voted in the top four or five players in the world but he doesn’t win African player of the year. We also won the Africa Cup of Nations and that is why he was expecting to win.“I will always be behind my brother but this is the game, sometimes you lose and sometimes you win. Yaya’s reaction is because he is a winner. I know deep inside he is a nice guy. I saw so many comments but I think the football world pushes him to do things that are not really him. He says some things that he doesn’t need to say. When you are a player you have to learn to be more relaxed. When you win, it is fun. When you lose, it is OK. This is life.”

Championship round-up: Middlesbrough stretch lead at the top
~CONTENTS~
Middlesbrough stretched their lead at the top of the Championship to six points with a 1-0 win at Brentford thanks to a goalkeeping howler from David Button.The Bees goalkeeper punched a second-half corner high into the air, slipped and could only look on as the ball rolled over the line.It was harsh on the Londoners who stood toe to toe with Aitor Karanka’s table-toppers and for long spells looked the better side.Derby County lost ground on Boro after they had to settle for a 1-1 draw against Reading at the iPro Stadium.Nick Blackman made his home debut against the club he left last week and his new side went ahead through Jason Shackell’s early strike. However, Daniel Williams headed the Royals level before half-time.Burnley made the most significant impact of the night after thrashing MK Dons 5-0 to record their first away league win since October and climb up to fourth place in the table.Joey Barton gave the Clarets the half-time lead before Sam Vokes, Andre Gray and Matt Lowton all found the back of the net. The Dons had their defender Antony Kay sent off after 75 minutes and the substitute George Boyd added another goal shortly afterwards.The game between Huddersfield Town and struggling Charlton Athletic at the John Smith’s Stadium was equally action-packed as the hosts won 5-0.First-half goals from Mark Hudson and Nahki Wells put the Terriers en route to a third consecutive home league triumph and Jamie Paterson and Duane Holmes netted in quick succession in the second half. The Charlton substitute Reza Ghoochannejhad was sent off after receiving two swift yellow cards before Jason Davidson struck a fifth in injury-time.Brett Pitman’s injury-time header kept Ipswich Town in the play-off places with a 2-1 victory over Leeds United, who took the lead after 12 seconds through Souleymane Doukara at Portman Road. Luke Chambers headed the equaliser for Mick McCarthy’s men.Brighton & Hove Albion’s slump continued at Rotherham United as they slipped to sixth place after a 2-0 defeat. Goals from Grant Ward and Matt Derbyshire gave the Millers a much-needed win, moving them three points clear of the relegation zone, and inflicted a fourth defeat in five league games on Albion.Bolton Wanderers stayed bottom after a 3-2 defeat by Sheffield Wednesday. Wanderers twice came from behind to equalise as goals from Gary Madine and David Wheater cancelled out efforts from Fernando Forestieri and Gary Hooper. But Hooper’s second of the match 13 minutes from time sent Neil Lennon’s team home empty-handed.Bristol City complete the bottom three, along with Charlton, after a 2-1 home defeat by Preston North End.Nathan Baker’s own-goal put the visitors ahead but Aaron Wilbraham quickly equalised, only for Greg Cunningham to head the winning goal against his old club in the 80th minute.Wolverhampton Wanderers began life after Benik Afobe with a 3-2 success over Fulham at Molineux. Their new signing Michal Zyro made an immediate impact with two early goals before Lasse Vigen Christensen pulled one back for Fulham midway through the first half. Matt Doherty restored the two-goal cushion shortly after the break and Ross McCormack responded for the visitors.Nottingham Forest stretched their unbeaten run to eight Championship games with a 1-1 draw against Birmingham City. Matt Mills cancelled out Jon Toral’s opener for the Blues before Reds midfielder David Vaughan was sent off in the second half.Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink came within five minutes of his first win as QPR manager but had to settle for a 1-1 draw at Blackburn Rovers. Leroy Fer put Rangers in front but Hope Akpan headed the equaliser five minutes from time.PosTeamPGDPts1Middlesbrough2525552Derby2620493Hull2518474Burnley2616455Ipswich265446Brighton264447Sheff Wed269428Birmingham263409Cardiff2543710Wolverhampton2613711Brentford2613612Reading2623413Preston2603414Nottm Forest2613215Leeds26-33216Huddersfield26-13117QPR26-33118Blackburn2512919Fulham26-42720Rotherham26-122421Milton Keynes Dons26-172322Bristol City26-232123Charlton26-262024Bolton26-2117

Guus Hiddink admits Chelsea are short of strikers and may make signing
~~AUTHOR~~
David Hytner
~CONTENTS~
Guus Hiddink has admitted that Chelsea are short in terms of options up front and has made it clear that the club are considering a move for a striker this month.With Radamel Falcao out with a thigh injury and Hiddink unable to put a time-frame on his return, the interim manager has only Diego Costa and the fit-again Loïc Rémy as established players to call upon.Football transfer rumours: Carlos Bacca and Alex Teixeira to Chelsea? Read moreRémy has been back in full training for two days after a calf problem, and he is expected to be in the squad for the visit of West Bromwich Albion on Wednesday night. Hiddink name-checked the 20-year-old Bertrand Traoré, whom he brought on as a late substitute in Sunday’s FA Cup win over Scunthorpe United, as a possible option but he said that Patrick Bamford, who has returned from a difficult loan spell at Crystal Palace, had “to prove himself first of all with the under-21s”.Hiddink talked about the need to have two quality players for every position and, when Costa and Rémy are fit, the situation does not overly concern him. But it was obvious that Hiddink would prefer to sign somebody as cover.“We are thinking,” Hiddink said. “We have to have good competition, good double occupation in every position. When there is good shape and the double occupation is there, then we are OK but we must not go into this danger when something happens with one or two strikers. I don’t deny that it would be a concern if Costa or Rémy were injured.“I am thinking. And it’s not good talk when you are thinking in this case because, why shall we go public? If, suppose something is going on, it can be harmful when you go public. Theoretically; that’s what I’m saying at the moment.”Roman Abramovich, the club’s owner, was at Cobham on Monday and Tuesday, and watched Hiddink’s squad train. “I have good contact here with the technical board and others,” Hiddink continued. “They are open to discuss all the options. That does not say it has to be done or it’s done but it’s open.“People come here and watch training and have normal conversations. I like it very much when people in charge of this club are not just always having a message but are also coming to enjoy it, to see the training and have lunch or a cup of coffee with the players.”Chelsea have been linked with a host of strikers, including Saido Berahino, but, unsurprisingly, Hiddink was tight-lipped when the West Brom player’s name came up. “The window opens and the mouth shuts,” he said.It was plain that Hiddink intends to rely on Rémy, who has enjoyed a stop-start season, and that the France player would not be going anywhere this month – a clutch of clubs have made enquiries about him.“Because we have this multitude of games, I hope Remy picks it up,” Hiddink said. “I hope he will deliver if he is needed. It’s short [the options up front], that’s true. I hope they will stay fit. When we have Costa and him – that’s why I hope Remy can make his next step and get even more fit. At the moment, no [Remy will not leave]. He will stay until the end of the season.”Falcao, who is on loan from Monaco, last appeared on 31 October as a substitute against Liverpool. The Monaco vice-president, Vadim Vasilyev, has said the Colombian would be out for “six to eight weeks” and there appears to be no prospect not only of Falcao returning to Monaco this month but of him moving anywhere.“It’s not easy [to leave in January] if you are injured and a long-time injury,” Hiddink said. “Everyone is intelligent and that’s not a reason to get a player back. If he is declared fit, then it will take time to get him game fit. I don’t know how long it will be in weeks. He is not on the [training] pitch so he is completely in the doctors’ and physios’ hands.”Hiddink reported that Costa (knee), Oscar (toe) and Nemanja Matic (mild concussion) would be fit for the West Brom game.

David Silva wants Manchester City to be a mean machine without Kompany
~~AUTHOR~~
Jamie Jackson
~CONTENTS~
David Silva has said Manchester City must work hard on conceding fewer goals, especially now their captain, Vincent Kompany, may not return until the closing part of the season because of his latest calf injury.Kompany suffered the 13th separate problem with his calf muscle since he joined City in August 2008 during the 4-1 Boxing Day win over Sunderland when he came on as a second-half substitute.Manuel Pellegrini is unsure when Kompany will be available, stating it may not be until “the final part of the season” and Silva is adamant City must defend better with or without him.The midfielder said: “He is a key player for us and our captain. With or without him we have to work hard to concede less. It’s a duty we have to fulfil before too long. Hopefully we can do that in this new year. It’s not just the defence that defends but the whole team.“It’s the same when we’re attacking – you need to have everyone helping out going forwards, so it’s down to us all to perform our defensive duties and it’s something we’ll be trying to do to help the cause.Arsenal and Manchester City battling to sign two Nigeria youth players Read more“Any team will miss their captain when they’re out and we’re no exception. When you look all over the field there are lots of figures willing to step up to the plate when needed.“We have lots of experience all over the team and it’s up to people like that to do that. Thinking positively, we’re battling on every front and involved in every trophy so it’s about trying to be involved as long as we can to the end of the season in each of those competitions.”Pellegrini said: “It’s difficult, because Vincent is doing a lot of different things to try to understand and find the reasons why he has so many injuries. It’s difficult for me to tell you an update about that. Maybe not so soon but for the last part of the season he could be fit.”The manager insisted Kompany’s injury will not force City into the transfer market.“We have Martín Demichelis, we have Nicolás Otamendi, we have Bacary Sagna, who can play in a central defensive position, we have Cameron [Humphreys], who is a young player who featured in pre-season with the squad. Eliaquim Mangala will return soon. Vincent maybe not so soon, but for the last part of the season, he could be fit. At this moment we are not thinking about making a change.”Pellegrini is without five players for Everton’s visit to the Etihad Stadium on Wednesday .“The injury situation is Kompany, Mangala, Fernandinho, Nasri and Bony. Those five players are injured and not fit. Mangala tried to work yesterday with normality but he couldn’t. He still has some pain in his muscle, so it’s better to wait a little bit more. I hope he will be ready soon, the same as Fernandinho and Bony. Nasri will be longer.”

Roberto Martínez admits Tim Howard could leave Everton in summer
~~AUTHOR~~
Andy Hunter
~CONTENTS~
Roberto Martínez has described Tim Howard as crucial to the development of his Everton team but admitted it is “impossible to say” the USA international will be at Goodison Park next season.Howard is set to be recalled for Everton’s Premier League trip to Manchester City on Wednesday having missed the last two games due to Martínez’s policy of selecting Joel Robles for the FA Cup and the Capital One Cup.Robles featured in victories against City in the Capital One Cup semi-final and Dagenham and Redbridge in the FA Cup while Howard received ironic cheers from supporters when claiming routine crosses during league defeats by Leicester City and Stoke City, reacting on both occasions.Martínez believes the 36-year-old’s strong performances, such as in the Boxing Day win at Newcastle United, are being overlooked and that the goalkeeper merits more appreciation. Howard’s experience behind an Everton defence disrupted by injury this season and his influence on young players remain vitally important, according to his manager.“I don’t think he was being sarcastic,” said Martínez of the veteran’s recent exchanges with the Goodison crowd. “He cares about our football club and has an incredible attachment to it. He is trying to interact with the fans with the experience he has. Tim would never blame a defender for his mistake and I appreciate that. Tim has got 350 appearances in the Premier League which is a record for Everton. He is part of our club and our badge.“He had mistakes but he had big moments. We need to be more understanding that sometimes you’re going to get that. His day-to-day work shows me the strength, power and positive effect he has on young players. I feel we are a stronger team with Tim Howard in the dressing room.”The Everton manager, however, refused to be drawn on Howard’s long-term plans should his relationship with supporters come under further strain. Howard is under contract at Everton until 2018 having been awarded a four-year extension in Martínez’s first season at the club. But the manager admitted there is doubt over the keeper’s intentions beyond this summer.“It is impossible to say that,” said Martínez when asked if Howard would be at Everton next season. “We need to take it game by game and week by week. I want Tim to feel stronger in every game. Watching him in training I don’t see a sign of weakness or him being worn down or tired. It is the opposite. He is up for the challenge, up for helping the team and keeping up standards. I’m sure every experience will affect what you want to do in the summer.“We shouldn’t look that far away. We are here with a real focus of winning on Wednesday. That is all that matters. We have a incredible squad, a group of players here that I’m excited about and I’m looking forward to seeing them develop and Tim Howard is a big part of that. Whatever happens at the end of the season you cannot guess it now and it would be wrong to try to guess that.”

Arsène Wenger banking on Joel Campbell for Arsenal after loans pay off
~~AUTHOR~~
James Riach
~CONTENTS~
Arsène Wenger has praised Joel Campbell’s recent performances for Arsenal, saying the Costa Rican has proved he can perform well under pressure.Campbell, who almost left the club in the summer, scored Arsenal’s equaliser in the FA Cup against Sunderland and was a regular in the side throughout December. The 23-year-old had been loaned out four times after signing in 2011, only making his first Premier League start against Swansea in October.Campbell has benefitted from Arsenal’s injuries and will have to fight for his place in the team once Alexis Sánchez, Santi Cazorla and Danny Welbeck regain fitness. Wenger has noticed a difference in the player since Arsenal’s crucial Champions League victory over Olympiakos last month, saying Campbell has more confidence and authority in his play.“I thought always the attitude was there,” Wenger said. “But after Olympiakos, in a game where we were like that, knife on the throat, he turned up with something special. Great team work and a pass for [Olivier] Giroud on a second goal that was massive for us. Then I thought ‘he can play under pressure as well, what is important for us’.“You want to be surprised by the quality of your players and where he surprises you is in the intensity of this teamwork. What is very interesting in Campbell’s case is that he looks like he has gained more confidence and authority in his game and in the final third he is a dangerous player and he has shown that. When you look at the player and the number of goals he scores and the number of assists, on that front you must say he has been very positive and he works hard for the team.”Campbell has been playing in a wider role, with Wenger selecting Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain in a more central position against Sunderland. The Arsenal manager considered loaning out Campbell again during the summer but has been pleasantly surprised he has risen to the challenge.“I flat-refused to let him go because I saw something in him that gives you belief, because of his attitude. It is true he had players in front of him and you think: ‘Can you block a player like that?’ But he was four times out on loan,” Wenger said.“He came back and you think: ‘Do I let him go out on loan again?’ Let’s keep him until January. You want to be surprised by the quality of your players and where he surprises you is in the intensity of his teamwork.”

Paul Dummett strike earns Newcastle draw against Manchester United
~~AUTHOR~~
Louise Taylor
~CONTENTS~
There were moments when Louis van Gaal looked slightly smug. At other times he seemed deeply frustrated and, occasionally, downright furious but there is one emotion Manchester United’s manager surely did not experience. It is safe to assume he was never bored by his team on Tuesday night.Even Van Gaal had confessed to finding his latest team a little dull lately but here they provided the perfect antidote. Almost a throwback to the glorious tactical “anarchy” of Alex Ferguson’s early reign this was a gloriously exciting game featuring two goals from Wayne Rooney, an impressive Newcastle United fightback and a host of defensive imperfections.Louis van Gaal blames Manchester United players for Newcastle draw Read moreWhen everyone finally drew breath Steve McClaren’s side were still third bottom and Manchester United had slipped to sixth but both managers expressed cautious reason to believe they can defy the bookmakers’ odds and keep their jobs.Once the £12m Jonjo Shelvey and the £4.5m Henri Saivet – signings from Swansea and Bordeaux respectively, who were paraded on the pitch before kick-off – begin fortifying midfield the Tynesiders should start climbing the table.Watching from the stands that pair bowed their heads as St James’ held a heartfelt minute of applause in celebration of the life of Pavel Srnicek, Newcastle’s hugely popular former goalkeeper who died of a cardiac arrest last month at the age of 47.Is it really 20 years since Srnicek was part of Kevin Keegan’s famous Newcastle “Entertainers” who, back in 1996, so memorably challenged Ferguson’s similarly swashbuckling Manchester United for the Premier League title?Two decades on both sides’s harbour distinctly downgraded ambitions with McClaren’s hopes of avoiding relegation swiftly receiving the latest in a long line of dents when his team somewhat harshly conceded a penalty.The former England coach has not had an awful lot of luck in recent months and here Chancel Mbemba was unfortunate to be judged guilty of handball after Marouane Fellaini rose to meet a corner and headed it straight at his marker’s admittedly extended arm.With no room to manoeuvre there was nothing Mbemba could do about it but, nonetheless, Mike Dean – who could perhaps argue the centre-half had no need to stick that limb out in the first place and had quite possibly blocked a goalbound header – pointed to the spot.Rooney stepped forward to send Rob Elliot the wrong way courtesy of a kick directed to the goalkeeper’s left. As it hit the back of the net, McClaren probably felt he had been kicked in the teeth.Even worse for Newcastle’s manager was the sense that the game was settling into an all too familiar pattern. By the end Manchester United were being bullied off the ball and had lost control of possession but, at this early juncture, they exuded an increasing aura of authority which was starting to depress the Gallowgate End.It could have been worse. When Rooney checked and cleverly beat the home offside trap before accelerating on to Jesse Lingard’s neat pass, he probably should have scored but instead shot narrowly wide.Georginio Wijnaldum suggested he, too, had misplaced his shooting boots when, having been put through by Ayoze Pérez, he aimed his shot far too close to David de Gea, permitting Van Gaal’s goalkeeper to save smartly with his legs.McClaren appeared to have genuine cause for complaint when Lingard looked to have tripped Daryl Janmaat in the area but, inexplicably, Dean refused to award a penalty and then again when Fellaini, already booked and getting away with a litany of niggly fouls, blatantly tugged Jack Colback back.It was time for Van Gaal’s players to show their more attractive side and, sure enough, when Ander Herrera collected a loose ball near the halfway line he provided Rooney with an exquisite pass. After holding the ball up intelligently – and holding off Fabricio Coloccini – Rooney slipped in a superb reverse pass which Lingard, making a blindside run, took in his stride before dispatching the ball low, and assuredly, beyond Elliot.Coloccini had seemed completely lost during that little cameo but Newcastle’s captain made amends with a diagonal pass from which Aleksandar Mitrovic beat Fellaini in the air and flicked on for Wijnaldum to volley unerringly past De Gea.Newcastle United fans unfurl protest banner aimed at Mike Ashley's Sports Direct Read moreIt was a fabulous finish which proved a precursor to a second-half Newcastle rally. Featuring Moussa Sissoko upping the tempo and driving his team forward at every opportunity it ensured unbridled optimism replaced earlier hints that mutiny might be simmering in the stands.This newly restored faith was very nearly punctured when Anthony Martial tricked Mbemba and Herrera played an adroit pass from which Lingard should have scored but instead curled his shot high and wide.It was a costly miss because when Chris Smalling wrestled Mitrovic to the floor as they jostled at a corner, Dean finally awarded Newcastle a penalty, crisply converted by the Serbia centre-forward.Wijnaldum had what would have been a sublime goal disallowed for offside before Rooney thought he had clinched it. Although Coloccini blocked Depay’s shot the ball rebounded to United’s captain whose wonderful first-time shot from just outside the area whizzed into the top corner.Then, just as locals were resigning themselves to by now customary disappointment, United failed to clear a cross. Meeting Mitrovic’s chestdown, Paul Dummett, McClaren’s left-back, swiped his left foot at the ball. A hefty deflection off Smalling ensured it evaded De Gea’s grasp and the smile was wiped from Van Gaal’s face.

Enner Valencia strikes twice as West Ham hit back to beat Bournemouth
~~AUTHOR~~
Ben Fisher
~CONTENTS~
The teams ran out on to the field to the soundtrack of Kanye West’s Power and the scene felt more akin to a Bournemouth nightclub but in the end there was no cause for celebration.Eddie Howe’s squad were boosted by three new signings this month for almost £20m – Benik Afobe, Juan Iturbe and the returning Lewis Grabban. Only four years ago Bournemouth shattered their transfer record on the striker Matt Tubbs, now at Portsmouth, for £800,000.This was supposed to be the start of a new era but Dimitri Payet’s magical display stole the show, leading to his manager, Slaven Bilic, labelling the Frenchman a bargain at £10.7m. Payet, making his first start since November due to injury, capped a fine display with an unstoppable free-kick which found its way into Artur Boruc’s goal and sent West Ham on their way to a third straight league victory.Slaven Bilic likens returning Dimitri Payet to Arsenal’s Mesut Özil Read more“West Ham fans love a player with a bit of magic and he has more than a bit,” said Bilic. “I do not know why people are so surprised because he came from one of the biggest clubs in Europe [Marseille]. Maybe we are giving him more responsibility but he is enjoying it and we are enjoying him. He is deciding the games, he is doing things that are very hard to do in football and he is bringing the whole team 20 yards up without even kicking a ball.”West Ham started the game with intent and played Bournemouth at their own game: hassling, pestering and pressing. Howe’s new £9m record signing Afobe was so keen to hit the ground running, he flew into the opposition half before the referee, Martin Atkinson, had even blown his whistle. Inside the first minute Bournemouth’s captain, Simon Francis, failed to clear Mark Noble’s high ball and his header landed at the feet of Michail Antonio, whose effort was kicked away by the feet of Boruc before the West Ham captain Noble fired the rebound over.Andy Carroll, in search of his third goal in three league matches, saw his evening end prematurely – the former England striker suffering a pulled hamstring after 15 minutes. “It is a bad situation for us,” said Bilic, without putting a timescale on Carroll’s possible return.Carroll’s early exit seemed to give Bournemouth the impetus to kick on. Andrew Surman passed the ball inside to Harry Arter, who veered away from Pedro Obiang before sending a low drive – too powerful for the palms of the West Ham keeper Adrián – into the bottom corner. Bournemouth were now in the groove. Matt Ritchie played a short corner with Adam Smith and the full-back crossed for Afobe, who nodded just over. Arter then dummied for Daniels, whose thumping left-foot shot forced a smart stop from the West Ham keeper.Just after Afobe wasted an opportunity when clean through on goal West Ham forced Boruc, a free transfer in the summer, into another fine save. Payet slid a pass through for Nikica Jelavic, Carroll’s replacement, whose shot from a tight angle deflected off the defender Steve Cook and goalwards only for Boruc’s strong left hand to intervene. Payet then left Boruc’s fingertips stinging after an acrobatic save.So much of West Ham’s success this season has stemmed from Payet and the winger began to take centre stage again. Payet was in a destructive mood and scored his sixth goal of the season with a right-foot free-kick after 67 minutes. Eight minutes later he turned provider for Enner Valencia, crossing for the Ecuadorian to lash home from inside the box.“When he makes a mistake in training that by his standards he should not have done he is crazy and he is angry at himself,” said Bilic. “That is what makes him a leader and a player that says, ‘OK, we are down, I have to step up’ and he came out second half and said it is going to be all about me.”After 84 minutes Valencia sealed West Ham’s fourth straight victory, sending his set piece, from an area not dissimilar to where Payet had previously prevailed, past a hapless Boruc.Bournemouth hope they have found a gem of their own in the on-loan Roma forward Iturbe, although he had a difficult evening. “It is difficult for Juan to come into that environment and I think we have work to do with him to get his fitness up,” said Howe. “I do not think we can expect too much from him too early.”

Aston Villa finally seal home league win thanks to Crystal Palace keeper
~~AUTHOR~~
Stuart James
~CONTENTS~
It has been a long time coming – 157 days to be exact – but the wait is finally over for Aston Villa supporters, who at last remembered what it feels like to win a Premier League match. Wayne Hennessey gave them more than a helping hand on a night when Joleon Lescott went some way to repairing the damage he did to his reputation in those unsavoury scenes at Wycombe Wanderers on Saturday.Involved in an ugly altercation with Villa supporters at Adams Park after taking part in a rather bizarre game that involved seeing how far he could spit his chewing gum while sitting on the bench, Lescott went from villain to hero in a little more than 72 hours with a precious goal that gave Rémi Garde his first win since taking over as manager on 3 November.Paul Dummett strike earns Newcastle draw against Manchester United Read moreThe Villa captain’s header ended up trickling over the line – Lescott could probably have propelled a stick of Wrigley further – and Hennessey will ruefully reflect on how he made the ball look like a bar of soap as it wriggled out of his hands and through his legs before goalline technology confirmed the inevitable. Yet all that mattered to Villa was that the goal was enough for them to pick up a rare three points – against a hugely disappointing Palace side who looked strangely out of sorts and, in the words of Alan Pardew, “never got going”.To put this result into context, it is Garde’s first victory as manager at the 11th attempt and the first time that Villa have won in the league at home in eight months, stretching back to a time when Tim Sherwood was in charge, the Midlands club were looking forward to an FA Cup final and there was an air of optimism about the place.The mood has turned mutinous of late and the chances are that this victory will count for very little in the grand scheme of things but at least it provided Villa fans with something to cheer. Garde’s side remain eight points adrift of safety with 17 games remaining and still require a minor miracle to avoid relegation but the impression at the end was that a cloud has been lifted.Asked whether Lescott owed the fans a performance after his part in that odd chewing gum game with Brad Guzan, Garde replied: “Maybe. The best is to ask him the question. I cannot answer for him. To be fair, I didn’t speak with Joleon about this stuff. I am pleased with the way he gave an answer tonight but not an answer regarding this [incident] – an answer regarding the fact he’s an experienced player and he should be very important for the team.”The big question for Villa is whether this win can be the platform for something bigger – if not an improbable great escape, then at least an improvement in results – and perhaps represent a turning point in their miserable season. “Hopefully [it can],” Garde said.“We have to stay very humble because it’s only three points. We’re far away from what we all want. Let’s hope this victory can give us a little bit more confidence. But not only the victory; the way we played tonight I didn’t see a bottom team – the difference between Palace and Aston Villa didn’t reflect the table. I want my players to be more confident and hopefully that’s what will happen.”That was a fair assessment on a night when Villa played with spirit throughout and grew in belief as the game went on. Wilfried Zaha’s shot hit the woodwork after only 44 seconds and Scott Dann spurned a decent chance late on but Pardew acknowledged that Villa were the better side, with Jordan Ayew the standout player on the pitch.“We came across an Aston Villa team tonight that worked very hard and from the videos and games I analysed that was their best performance and we struggled to cope with it,” the Palace manager said. “We’ve been struggling offensively with injuries and I thought going forward tonight that really wasn’t us.”Garde made some bold calls by leaving Guzan on the bench and giving Mark Bunn his first league game since May 2013. Libor Kozak also came in out of the cold, with the Czech Republic striker granted his first start in more than two years in a move that felt born of desperation more than anything else.Kozak came close to scoring early in the second half, when his low deflected shot was turned round a post by Hennessey in what was a fine save from the Palace keeper, yet the Welshman’s next contribution provided a moment to forget. Lescott towered above Dann and Connor Wickham, who came on at half-time as Pardew tried to give his side more of an attacking threat, and the defender’s header ended up rolling just over the line after Hennessey made a pig’s ear of holding on to the ball.Lescott’s reaction was subdued – perhaps not surprising in the circumstances – but there was nothing muted about Villa’s celebrations at the final whistle. “The goal was disappointing,” Pardew said. “I think Wayne’s first touch puts him in trouble. He’s been brilliant for us. His mistake tonight cost us the goal but we made mistakes in other areas all night and they of course go unnoticed while the goal is a highlight for everyone else.“I don’t want to take too much away from Villa. They deserved the win and my team didn’t play well. The Premier League would not want to lose a club of this magnitude. I hope they can resolve it.”

Newcastle United fans unfurl protest banner aimed at Mike Ashley's Sports Direct

~CONTENTS~
Newcastle United fans have launched one of their most public demonstrations so far against the club’s billionaire owner Mike Ashley, unveiling a banner at Tuesday night’s clash with Manchester United to protest about the way he runs his embattled retail chain, Sports Direct. Fans along the Gallowgate stand unfurled the banner, reading “#SportsDirectShame”, near the end of the first half of the match.It is the latest in a string of protests against Ashley’s ownership of the football club that he bought in 2007. The sportswear chain is also embroiled in ongoing controversy over working conditions and pay.Approximately £1bn has been wiped off Sports Direct’s stock market value this year following concerns over the company’s trading raised by a Guardian investigation in December, which found that the retailer was effectively paying thousands of temporary warehouse workers below the national minimum wage.The Guardian’s reports led to a question in parliament and calls for an investigation by HM Revenue & Customs, as well as criticism from the Institute of Directors, which branded Sports Direct a “scar on British business”.On New Year’s Eve, Sports Direct pledged £10m for a pay rise for staff from the start of this year. Ashley has also promised to lead a review of all Sports Direct’s temporary staff terms and conditions.

Jonjo Shelvey signs for Newcastle in £12m transfer from Swansea
~CONTENTS~
The Swansea midfielder Jonjo Shelvey has completed his move to Newcastle after signing a five-and-a-half-year deal.The 23-year-old England international put pen to paper for an undisclosed fee understood to be in the region of £12m after travelling to Tyneside for a medical and talks on Tuesday.Shelvey is the club’s second new signing in 24 hours following the arrival of Henri Saivet from Bordeaux, also on a long-term deal and for a fee understood to amount to around £5m.He said: “I’m very excited to be here. I’m so glad that it’s finally done. I drove up through the night to be here, so it’s been a manic 24 hours but it’s all been worth it to come here and play for this great club.”Shelvey has been in Newcastle’s sights for several years but his move comes after he found himself a peripheral figure at the Liberty Stadium in recent weeks.He made his last appearance for the Swans, who are one point better off than the relegation-threatened Magpies, in Sunday’s 3-2 FA Cup third-round defeat at League Two Oxford, after which he became involved in a row with a disgruntled fan as he left the pitch.The Newcastle head coach, Steve McClaren, has been desperate to add players who know the Premier League to his squad after seeing his summer signings Aleksandar Mitrovic and Florian Thauvin struggle to establish themselves in English football.McClaren said: “I’m delighted to welcome Jonjo to Newcastle United. He has great experience for a young English central midfielder and he is a current England international, so I’m certain he will be a great addition to the squad.“He is a player we have admired for some time and we’re very pleased that we’ve now been able to bring him here.”While Newcastle have concentrated their early activity on central midfield, there is little doubt that their main focus has to be addressing a crippling lack of goals – they have scored only 22 in their 21 league games to date, and six of those came on one afternoon against Norwich.To that end they are maintaining an interest in the Tottenham and England winger Andros Townsend and are hopeful progress can be made on that front as well as pursuing a series of striking targets.They received no encouragement whatsoever in their inquiries over Lyon’s Alexandre Lacazette but remain on the trail of Wolfsburg’s Bas Dost and are keeping close tabs on developments with their former striker Andy Carroll, now at West Ham, and West Brom’s Saido Berahino, another player they have watched for some time.However, their focus on QPR’s Charlie Austin appears to be dwindling with concerns over injuries and the apparent willingness of the player to remain where he is and run down his contract, making his capture less likely.Steve McClaren urges Newcastle United owner Mike Ashley to splash cash Read more

Nemanja Vidic is set to leave Internazionale with immediate effect. The Serbian defender has struggled with injuries and his relationship with the manager, Roberto Mancini, has suffered as a result. He has not played for the club this season.The former Manchester United defender had five months left of the two-year-contract he signed in the summer of 2014.On Tuesday the player’s representatives were in negotiations with the club over the terms of his departure. Vidic is one of Inter’s highest earners and the club are keen to free up funds to make signings in January.Genoa’s Armando Izzo is thought to be high on Mancini’s wishlist to join Inter when Vidic leaves. Fellow defender Andrea Ranocchia could also leave the Milan club in this transfer window.The 34-year-old, who was sent off on his league debut in Italy, has made only 23 Serie A appearances. He left United in 2014 after eight and a half successful years in England, where he won five league titles as well as the Champions League in 2008.

Oldham have parted company with their manager David Dunn after just three months in permanent charge.The Oldham chairman, Simon Corney, told the club website: “I would like to place on record my thanks and gratitude to David for his tireless efforts over the past four months under what have been extremely difficult circumstances and wish him all the best for the future. He retained his dignity at all times and his hard work and dedication has been commendable.”The assistant manager, Dean Holden, has also left the club with Corney saying: “Dean has been a loyal and dedicated servant to the club and he leaves with our gratitude and best wishes.”The first-team coach, Keith Brown, has also left his role.The former Blackburn Rovers midfielder was appointed to the post in October having acted as interim manager following the departure of Darren Kelly the previous month.At the time, Corney said: “His dedication, hard work and exacting standards have already had a positive effect on the club and the way he has approached the role has made it impossible for us not to give him his chance.“We believe his ambition, skills and positive influence will be pivotal to the club’s progression.”Oldham, who are without a win in eight games, are currently third from bottom in League One and visit mid-table Bradford on Saturday.

Bouncing around aimlessly in a passable homage to the title sequence of The Prisoner
~~AUTHOR~~
Scott Murray
~CONTENTS~
HE IS NOT A NUMBER, HE IS A FREE LOANOne of the first things Jürgen Klopp did upon arriving at Liverpool was to draw up a shopping list of central defenders who might eventually replace the monumentally confused Dejan Lovren, balsa-boned Mamadou Sakho, Kolo Touré, 57, and Martin Skrtel, who at first glance looks like the sort of bloke who should be on trial for some very serious breaches of humanitarian protocol, but in fact, if the manner in which he attacks the ball while defending deep crosses is anything to go by, is the sort of sweet-hearted young lad who would faint in fear at a Talulah Gosh gig. Looks can be deceptive. Nothing wrong with sensitive twee-pop sensibilities, of course, but when push comes to shove, he might not be cut out for Klopp’s heavy-metal brand of football, is all. So Klopp handed his list to Ian Ayre. The Liverpool chief suit roared off on his chopper, and a few hours later came back with a broad, satisfied smile on his boat and some booty packed into his pannier. “Hey Jürgen!” chirped Ayre as he hopped, big leggy, off his Harley. “You know you wanted Neven Subotic, Joël Matip or Mats Hummels? Well, even better than that!” And with a flourish, in the style of the guy from the Fast Show who would be sent out to the shops for eggs and potatoes before coming back with biscuits shaped like radios and a map of Cairo, he presented Klopp with new loan signing Steven Caulker, a man last seen in the centre of a Southampton defence that shipped six goals at home to Liverpool in the Milk Cup, bouncing around aimlessly in a passable homage to the title sequence of The Prisoner.The resulting mushroom clouds which emerged reasonably quickly from Klopp’s ears could be seen as far away as Newcastle, where today’s other big bit of transfer news was occurring. The Magpies have bid £12m for Jonjo Shelvey, who may have decided it’s an appropriate time to leave Swansea, having last weekend reportedly been involved in a Hegelian dialectic with several fans in the wake of their FA Cup defeat at Oxford, a trenchant swapping of thesis and antithesis which nearly led to a good old-fashioned synthesis in the car park. Shelvey’s arrival on Tyneside – likely to hasten the departure of 2011’s Cheick Tioté to Shanghai Greenland Shenhua for £8m – is dependent on a medical. Let’s hope the Toon doctors realise his seeming inability to break into a run is less a physical problem and more a manifestation of the trademark insouciant style so beloved by those aforementioned Swans supporters.LIVE ON BIG WEBSITEJoin Scott Murray from 7.45pm GMT for hot MBM coverage of Newcastle United 0-1 Manchester United.QUOTE OF THE DAY7.22am: “I am sorry [about the speculation].

Why Savio Nsereko is one of the Premier League's worst ever record signings
~CONTENTS~
There have been some dreadful club record signings in Premier League history. The broadcast TV deals of this era have granted football clubs Scrooge McDuck levels of wealth. Unfortunately, this has often left them with more money than sense as they recklessly invest vast sums into players with a wanton disregard for the consequences, effectively lighting their cigars with rolled up £50 notes like cartoon villains. Although there are many instances of clubs splashing cash on players who turned out to be utterly useless for them, there is one example that stands head and shoulders above the rest. Step forward Savio Nsereko.January 2009 was a relatively exciting period of time at West Ham. They were still owned by the Icelandic consortium headed by Bjorgolfur Gudmundsson and the club was a few months into the reign of Gianfranco Zola, who had been appointed manager after Alan Curbishley’s resignation the previous September. Although there were were apprehensions from fans about the appointment, the Italian was beginning to win over fans by playing an expansive and creative brand of football.Zola joined West Ham after the closure of the summer transfer window, so January brought his first foray into the market. There was an element of unrest among fans when the club decided to sell their record signing, Craig Bellamy, to Manchester City for £14m halfway through the window. The fans were promised that the money would be reinvested in a new forward. A week later, West Ham announced they had broken their transfer record to sign Nsereko, a Uganda-born German striker, from Brescia for a fee upwards of £9m.The age of information is denying football fans the joy of the unknown Read moreNeedless to say, a few eyebrows were raised. Nsereko was an unknown quantity for the vast majority of fans and there was understandable scepticism given that the club had committed to their biggest transfer outlay of all time on a player who had made just 23 league appearances and scored three senior goals for a team playing in Serie B.Still, plenty of players have been plucked from relative obscurity and gone on to have successful careers in England, and Nsereko came with a good reputation after being named player of the tournament in the European Under-19 Championship in 2008. He was given the No10 shirt vacated by Bellamy and there was a sense of quiet anticipation around Upton Park as their new forward made his debut from the bench against Hull City two days after signing.While hardly setting the world alight in his brief cameo as a substitute, he showed a few signs of promise. It was clear that he was technically competent and showed a sharpness of mind and foot that suggested he might be able to compensate for his physical deficiencies. You could see that perhaps the West Ham manager saw something of himself in the young German – a diminutive, creative forward who relied on guile rather than brute force; someone to pick the lock rather than batter the door down.As time went on, it became increasingly clear that his physical fragility was going to prove too big an obstacle for him to overcome. He struggled to dislodge Carlton Cole and David Di Michele from the first team, which meant he was limited to appearances from the bench. He failed to impact games as a substitute and, despite being tidy in possession, he was a Jenga tower of a forward player – he often looked unsteady and was liable to be sprawled across the floor following the merest contact. Something was evidently not right.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Savio Nsereko spent much of his time at West Ham on the bench as he struggled to make an impact. Photograph: Hamish Blair/Getty ImagesClubs employ a variety of responses when their big-money acquisitions aren’t working out. Some clubs pigheadedly persevere with their player, stubbornly refusing to acknowledge the reality of the situation, like a doctor desperately performing CPR long after the patient has stopped breathing. Others simply freeze them out and let them rot in the reserves. Then there are those who simply cut their losses and sell to whoever is willing to buy, even if it means a reduction in transfer fee. West Ham took the final option when it came to Nsereko.They shipped him off to Fiorentina after just six months for a fee reported to be £3m, with Portuguese centre-half Manuel da Costa moving the other way as part of the deal. He made only 10 appearances in claret and blue, only one of which was a start, and he failed to score for the club. While his time in east London was undeniably disappointing, he was hardly the first player to fail to settle in England, and nor was he the first player to struggle to adapt to the physical demands of the Premier League, so a move back to Italy, where he had shown promise as a teenager at Brescia, seemed like a viable opportunity for him to get his career back on track.It did not work out that way though. Nobody could have predicted how spectacularly Nsereko’s career would derail from this point forward. In Florence he once again found himself stuck on the periphery of the first team. Five moths after returning to Italy he found himself out on loan at Bologna. His time there was unproductive though, managing only two games in a six-month spell before returning to his parent club.His spell at Bologna was to be a portent of things to come, as Nsereko spent the remaining years of his Fiorentina contract on a series of loans at clubs across Europe. He returned to Germany to play for 1860 Munich in the second tier, before going to Chernomorets Burgas in Bulgaria, Juve Stabia in Serie B and then to FC Vaslui in Romania, before a final loan spell back in Munich, this time in the third division with SpVgg Unterhaching, where he would eventually sign a permanent free transfer.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Nsereko showed glimpses of potential, but failed to register a single goal for West Ham before returning to Italy. Photograph: Hamish Blair/Getty ImagesIn all of these loan periods over the course of three seasons, he only played more than two league games for Chernomorets Burgas in Bulgaria. This lack of appearances and failure to settle anywhere seemed to be a product of the plague of personal problems that seemed to follow the striker wherever he went.His contracts at 1860 and Juve Stabia were both cancelled after he went AWOL and he was released from SpVgg Unterhaching after just two months for a breach of contract. The nadir of his personal issues came in 2012 when he was arrested by Thai authorities and sent to jail for weeks after faking his own kidnapping in an attempt to ransom money from his own family.After his release from Unterhaching, Nsereko embarked on a nomadic career that would rival that of Trevor Benjamin. He racked up a handful of games in regional German football for FC Viktoria Köln, as well as for Hapoel Ironi Akko in Israel, before finding his way to Kazakhstan. He signed for FC Atyrau in 2014, a team that had finished 11th in the Kazakhstan Premier League in the previous season and marked his debut with a goal in a 1-0 victory that was voted goal of the season by the club’s fans. Staggeringly, it was the first professional goal he had scored since he was a teenager at Brescia in January 2009.To put that into context, before his goal for Atyrau, the last time Nsereko scored George W Bush was still US president, Portsmouth were the holders of the FA Cup and Justin Bieber had yet to release his first single. It was a goal worthy of the accolade too, as he collected the ball on the left touchline, cut inside and rode a challenge before rifling a shot in from 35 yards: a tantalising glimpse of his capabilities. He left the club in June 2014 after just 10 appearances and had been without a club for over a year when he signed for Beroe Stara Zagora of the Bulgarian Premier League, where he played his mandatory handful of games before being released in July 2015. He is currently a free agent.So what went wrong? In 2012, Karren Brady announced she was going to investigate the Nsereko deal that the previous board had overseen, citing the huge financial loss West Ham incurred by selling the player for so cheap just six months into his contract. With hindsight, perhaps she was right to be suspicious. West Ham’s technical director at the time, Gianluca Nani, had pre-existing relationships with Nsereko and Brescia – he had brokered the deal that took the player to Brescia from Hertha Berlin at the age of 16, and was the son-in-law of Brescia president Luigi Corioni. The findings of Brady’s investigation were never made public and the club has not elaborated on the deal since then.Perhaps Nsereko was simply not that talented in the first place and was the victim of an artificially inflated transfer fee. Still, he clearly had some ability as he was a member of a Germany Under-19 team that won the European Championship for their age group, a side that featured both Bender brothers, who went on to be full senior internationals.It seems that the cause of his downfall had more to do with his newfound levels of fame and fortune than anything else. In 2013, Nsereko admitted that he had “lost grip with reality” when it came to the vast wealth he found at his disposal and his botched fake kidnapping was a way to pay off his debts and sustain his extravagant lifestyle. In this regard, his story could act as a cautionary tale for young footballers who suddenly find themselves wildly rich. Nsereko is still only 26 and there is still time for him to turn things around, however unlikely that may seem given his past. If nothing else, he has a strong claim to be the worst record signing in Premier League history.• This article appeared first on These Football Times• Follow Tom Mason and These Football Times on Twitter

Quique Sánchez Flores: Watford interested in Andros Townsend
~CONTENTS~
Quique Sánchez Flores said Andros Townsend is exactly the type of player Watford need. Flores has been linked with a move for the Tottenham winger and his former White Hart Lane team-mate Emmanuel Adebayor, who is a free agent.Watford reportedly had a £10m bid for Townsend turned down earlier this month, and Sanchez clearly remains keen on the 24-year-old England internationalLuis Enrique: Barcelona hoping to add to forward power this month Read more“He has the characteristics that we are looking for,” said the manager. “We have players in the side who can play intelligent football but we need skill, we need velocity. We need to make a balance with these players and he has the characteristics. I don’t like to talk about names but these are the kind of characteristics we are looking for.”Flores would not confirm or deny moves for either player but admits he may struggle to persuade Adebayor to be a third-choice striker behind his regular front two, Troy Deeney and Odion Ighalo.“I can understand why a lot of clubs in England want to sign Adebayor,” Flores said. “He’s 31, he has quality, he has experience, he has goals. So I understand that he can choose where he wants to play in the Premier League.“It’s not easy to come here to cover Deeney and Ighalo. They have a high performance every time and they are part of the soul of this team. It’s difficult to challenge these players, so we need to be sensitive.“We need to explain to the players on what condition they’re coming to this team. I don’t want any players coming here to cover strikers that think they are going to play easily, because it’s not the real situation. We play with two strikers but it’s difficult to take them out of the team, including in the match.”Watford head to Southampton on Wednesday in search of a first win in four Premier League matches.Ronald Koeman’s Saints have hit a miserable run of form with one win in their last 10 game in all competitions, a far cry from their impressive campaign last season.Sanchez feels Southampton may have overachieved last term, when they finished seventh but is still anticipating a tough match.“Maybe Southampton last year were better than the squad they have,” he said. “They were fighting against Chelsea, Arsenal, Manchester United, Manchester City, amazing teams. Sometimes one team is doing amazing performances under the level that they have.“Results are important for the confidence of the players. They didn’t start well so they have problems with confidence but they have an amazing team, a good manager, so the match will be tough for us.”

Luis Enrique: Barcelona hoping to add to forward power this month
~CONTENTS~
Barcelona are looking to reinforce their formidable attack in the January transfer window, Luis Enrique said.Barça have one of the most potent forward lines in the world in Fifa Ballon d’Or winner Lionel Messi, Neymar and Luis Suárez but lack a reliable replacement if any of the prolific South Americans are sidelined.How Johan Cruyff nearly signed for Leicester City in 1981 Read moreAcademy graduates Munir el Haddadi and Sandro Ramírez are the only other recognised forwards in the squad but have failed to impress since their promotion from the B team.“Right now our greatest need is to strengthen the attacking line but I would like bring in reinforcements across the board,” Luis Enrique said. “Negotiations are tough in the winter market because nobody wants to let important players go,” added the former Barça and Spain midfielder. “We will try right up until the final day.”One option for Barça could be bringing back the former Manchester City winger Denis Suárez. A jewel in Celta Vigo’s youth ranks, Suárez was chased by a number of top European clubs before he decided to join City in 2011 aged 17.Opportunities for young players were slim and after a couple of seasons in which he made only a handful of first-team appearances he signed for Barça. The 22-year-old performed well on loan at Sevilla in 2014-15 and has become an integral part of a Villarreal side who are riding high in fourth in La Liga.Barça take a 4-1 lead over Espanyol into Wednesday’s Copa del Rey second leg. Recent meetings have been brutal affairs and Luis Enrique and his Espanyol counterpart Constantin Galca have urged the players and fans to focus on playing football.Luis Suárez is banned for the game at Cornellà-El Prat after he became involved in a fracas after the end of last week’s first leg at Camp Nou, during which Espanyol had two players sent off.Luis Enrique said: “We need to approach the match as if it was a single game and not a two-leg tie. Playing Espanyol is always stimulating.”

Manuel Pellegrini has admitted Vincent Kompany may not return until the “last part of the season” due to his latest calf injury.The Manchester City captain suffered the problem after coming on as a second-half substitute against Sunderland on Boxing Day, Kompany subsequently having to be replaced himself.Tim Howard will be back for Everton against Manchester City Read moreThis was the 13th separate calf injury the Belgium defender has suffered since he joined the club in August 2008. City’s medical department are continuing to try and find a long-term solution that will solve the continuing setbacks with the muscle.Asked when the central defender may return before the visit of Everton on Wednesday, Pellegrini said: “Its difficult to know.

Tim Howard’s ‘unique experience’ earns Everton recall at Manchester City
~~AUTHOR~~
Andy Hunter
~CONTENTS~
Tim Howard is set for an Everton recall at Manchester City on Wednesday despite his recent struggle for form and Joel Robles’ assured displays in cup competitions.The 36-year-old gave way to the Spanish keeper for Everton’s Capital One Cup semi-final win over City and the FA Cup defeat of Dagenham & Redbridge on Saturday in keeping with Roberto Martínez’s selection policy. Howard had come in for fierce criticism from supporters before the cup ties for failing to command his area, prompting a reaction from the USA international in league defeats to Leicester City and Stoke City.Martínez insists the veteran’s experience is invaluable behind a defence frequently disrupted by injury this season and indicated Howard will reclaim his place at the Etihad Stadium.“We want to improve in every position and have good competition and Joel has been terrific,” said the Everton manager, who faces City again at the end of the month in the second leg of the Capital One Cup semi-final.“He’s done really well but Tim brings unique experience and knowhow. You have good and bad moments but we appreciate what Tim brings on top of being between the sticks. He will be the first Everton player to have 350 appearances in the Premier League and it’s time we used that experience to develop our youngsters. We feel we are very strong in goalkeeping area.”The leading goalscorer, Romelu Lukaku, is fit to face Manuel Pellegrini’s side having injured an ankle when scoring the winner in that first leg at Goodison Park.Martínez said: “Rom trained 100%. He feels really good and his recovery had gone according to plan and he is clear to play. In any game, in the kind of form he’s shown, he’s very important. On top of that he has that scoring touch and would be needed in any team. He wants to carry that responsibility and we don’t want that to stop.”Martínez also confirmed the defender Ramiro Funes Mori will be available despite requiring 10 stitches in a head wound. Tom Cleverley remains doubtful with a calf injury and Seamus Coleman will be sidelined for “another 10 to 15 days”, according to Martínez, with a similar problem sustained against City last week.

Roy Hodgson fielded the youngest team of any European country during 2015, according to the CIES Football Observatory.The research group based at the International Centre for Sports Studies in Switzerland has analysed the characteristics of players fielded by the top 50 national teams last year and found England’s average age of 25.6 years was beaten only by three African nations – Nigeria, Ghana and Cameroon –- and level with Holland.David Squires on … football's proposed trials of video replays Read more“The bias towards youth has not been a success as the Dutch failed to qualify for Euro 2016,” reads the report. “For the English, on the other hand, the results have been more positive. The youthfulness of the players available to Roy Hodgson is the sign of a renaissance which suggests a promising future.”England qualified for Euro 2016 by winning all 10 of their matches and will face Russia, Wales and Slovakia at the tournament this summer. Wales, who will play in their first major tournament finals since 1958, fielded a team with an average age of 26.5 while Northern Ireland’s was above to average at 28.2.Scotland’s campaign came to an end when they finished fourth in their qualifying group behind Germany, Poland and the Republic of Ireland and Gordon Strachan’s side was also the oldest at an average of exactly 29 years. “It is no doubt timely to carry out an in-depth analysis to understand the reasons for multiple failures over the past decades,” adds the report.The research also looked into several other categories including height and weight, employer clubs and place of birth. England was revealed to have the lightest average squad in Europe at 73.5kg (11st 7lb), while Serbia had the heaviest and tallest.England were also found to be one of 11 countries with every players employed by top-flight clubs, while Northern Ireland were the lowest at 54.5%.

Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang: ‘I don’t know why Yaya Touré was so angry’
~~AUTHOR~~
Guardian sport
~CONTENTS~
Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has said he is nonplussed as to why Yaya Touré was so angry about the Borussia Dortmund player being voted the Africa player of the year last week. Touré hit out at the decision, saying it was “pathetic”, “indecent” and brought “shame to Africa”.Aubameyang is back with Dortmund now as they prepare for the restart of the Bundesliga and, talking to Sport Bild, he said: “I really don’t know why he said that at all. I am not going to get angry about it and for me it is already an old story, gone. It simply does not interest me.”Yaya Touré’s comments lack class and risk overshadowing his wonderful talent Read moreThe Gabon striker received 143 points to Touré’s 136 with Swansea’s André Ayew finishing third with 112. Touré appeared to congratulate his rivals on stage, saying he was “disappointed” but adding that Aubameyang had “been doing brilliantly well this year”.However, the Manchester City midfielder later seemed to suggest the voting had been unfair given his country’s success at the Nations Cup. “I’m very disappointed. It’s sad to see Africa react this way, that they don’t think African achievements are important,” he told the French radio station RFI.“I think this is what brings shame to Africa, because to act in that way is indecent. But what can we do about it? Us Africans, we don’t show that Africa is important in our eyes. We favour more what’s abroad than our own continent. That is pathetic.”Aubameyang wants to focus on Dortmund and the Bundesliga, with his side second, eight points behind Bayern Munich. “We will certainly not give up without a fight and all is not lost yet. We know that it will be very difficult to stop Bayern winning the league but nothing is impossible,” he said.For their part, Dortmund have said they intend to hold on to all their key players in the winter transfer window.The chief executive Hans-Joachim Watzke said: “I can rule out transfer of any of our top performers now. That’s definitely not on our agenda.“Speculation regarding the future of Aubameyang and the playmaker Ilkay Gündogan has been mounting in recent weeks with the Germany midfielder recently saying that he had not yet decided whether to extend his 2017 contract with the club, who are currently second in the standings.The captain Mats Hummels has also been linked with a possible move, with the player having said in the past he could see himself playing abroad at some point in his career.

Schalke have dismissed reports their talented 20-year-old attacking midfielder Leroy Sané has a buyout clause in his contract that could allow him to move this year against the club’s will.Sané, whose contract runs to 2017, has been this season’s Bundesliga revelation, scoring four goals and setting up another four as his form carried him all the way to the German national team and his first senior cap last year.Manchester City target move for Schalke and Germany forward Leroy Sané Read moreHe needed 31 Bundesliga matches – including 17 this season – to achieve this, and Schalke have repeatedly said they are not planning to release the player, who had spent six years playing for their youth teams.“There is no buyout clause in force for Sané, neither for this winter nor for the summer,” the Schalke sports director, Horst Heldt, said on Twitter after reports of a possible departure.Bild newspaper reported this week he had a buyout clause of €37m (£28m), meaning a team could offer that amount and sign the player despite his contract with Schalke.German media have reported interest from top clubs, in Spain and in the Premier League, for the creative and quick player but Schalke have denied receiving any specific offers.The Ruhr valley club, in sixth place this season, are under mounting pressure from their fans to hold on to Sané after they allowed another youth product, the Germany international and World Cup winner Julian Draxler, to move to Wolfsburg this season for an estimated £25.5m.

How Johan Cruyff nearly signed for Leicester City in 1981
~~AUTHOR~~
Jeff Livingstone
~CONTENTS~
January 1981. The UK, like much of Europe, is in the midst of one of the coldest winters it has witnessed for many years. Among the stories making the headlines this month: Peter Sutcliffe, a lorry driver from Bradford, is arrested and accused of murdering 20-year-old university student Jacqueline Hill. The British Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, agrees to relent on a decision to close 23 working and profitable coalmines amid the threat of industrial action by the National Union of Mineworkers. The agreement is flimsy and ambiguous though, and the issue of pit closures will come to fore again soon. In the US, Ronald Reagan is sworn in as President, the former Hollywood actor replacing Jimmy Carter.In the industrial heartlands of England, the good people of Leicester go on with their lives. A killer targeting West Yorkshire, but feared nationwide, is in police custody. A return to the three-day week has been averted, but Leicester City are still 22nd in the First Division and facing relegation. In his office at Leicester City’s Filbert Street, John “Jock” Martin Bokas Wallace reclines into his leather chair and considers the league table. Jock Wallace, who has enjoyed nothing but success in his managerial career to date, including two treble-winning seasons in Scotland with Rangers, is not used to failure, and he is not keen to become acquainted with it now.A home defeat in Leicester’s last First Division match against Leeds United was tough on his team, but a 3-1 reverse in an FA Cup replay at Exeter City was an embarrassment – a stain on his reputation. What is going wrong?Wallace’s rigorous training methods have been in place at Leicester City for three years. Using powerful earth movers, the club indulged Wallace’s request to recreate the sand dunes of Gullane on the Ayrshire coast. Once referred to as “murder hill” by his Rangers players, the famously high dunes were a punishing focal point of their fitness regime and widely considered a contributing factor in their 1970s success. Here at Leicester, Wallace has a pseudo-Gullane, which is manmade but effective. The players are well drilled and as fit as any in the division. It is not the fitness. It cannot be the fitness.It is not the players’ diet either. Wallace is ahead of his time on this score. He has a young side; there are no beer-swilling, cigarette-smoking layabouts here. These are players physically equipped to deal with the increasing pace of the English top flight.The balance is right too. This is a team that romped through the Second Division last season. A young team with an average age of 23, studded with talented players such as Jim Melrose, John O’Neill and Ian Wilson. A young team. A young team – maybe that’s the problem.A young team needs a senior figure, a totem, a focal point. An experienced leader who can them away from the lower reaches of the First Division. Wallace can get his message across in the dressing room – if he asks these lads to jump they ask, “How high boss?” – but someone on the pitch, a guide, someone to inspire. Jock Wallace is distracted by the telephone.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Jock Wallace at Leicester City. Photograph: Colorsport/Rex/ShutterstockJanuary 1981 had not gone well for Jock Wallace and Leicester City. The ignominious defeat at Exeter at least offered the chance to play the favoured card of struggling teams everywhere, “we can concentrate on survival now”. However, a cursory glance at the fixture list for the final day of the month did not offer any cause for optimism. In the First Division on 31 January 1981, Leicester City would be playing away to the English champions and the European champions elect, Liverpool, at Anfield.Behind the scenes, though, there was a buzz at Filbert Street that Wallace and a few others were in on. The club had identified a new player: the experienced leader they so desperately needed. He ticked all of the boxes and then some. He was available and wanted to join. Johan Cruyff, the masterful Dutch artist, was on his way to England.Wallace had a reputation for extended team meetings that could often include the entire squad, the kit man and, allegedly, the tea lady. Whether everyone involved with the first team was in on the buzz is open to conjecture, but something was clearly in the air. While many expected Liverpool to pick up another three easy points at Anfield, Leicester’s players went there and won 2-1, with Jim Melrose scoring the deciding goal to end Liverpool’s record 85-match unbeaten run at their home ground. Leicester were bottom of the First Division and Liverpool had not lost at home for three years. Three years! In those three years, the champions had only conceded 35 goals. They leaked two that day, and it was enough.Aged 33, Cruyff was perhaps a little past his best, having retired from international football in 1977. However, a slightly past his best Cruyff was still as good a player as anyone in January 1981. Three years before, Cruyff was persuaded, like Franz Beckenbauer and Pelé before him, that the razzmatazz of the North American Soccer League was where it was at. In late 1978 the embodiment of Total Football joined the Los Angeles Aztecs, where he would go on to register 14 goals in 27 games.Cruyff’s first season in LA would also be his last. Crowned the league’s Most Valuable Player for the 1979 season, he relocated east, signing for the Washington Diplomats in what would be a final NASL hurrah for both club and player. He played a full season with the Diplomats but the anticipated US soccer boom had not materialised. The Diplomats eventually folded in 1981 when then owner, the Madison Square Garden Corp, revealed accumulated losses of $6m. At the time, Diplomats’ president Steve Danzansky confirmed he could not gather enough money to keep the team alive. At the end of 1980, it was clear he could not afford to pay the wages his star player.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Johan Cruyff playing for the LA Aztecs in 1979 USA. Photograph: Colorsport/Rex/ShutterstockAs 1980 became 1981, Cruyff still had much to offer. Terminating his contract with Washington after just five games of the 1981 NASL season, the Dutchman was in good shape and ready for a return to Europe. With the 1982 World Cup in Spain less than 18 months away, Cruyff was keen to return to the international scene with Holland, but needed to play regular club football in Europe to remain in consideration.Word quickly spread that a window of opportunity had opened. A lucky employer could recruit one of the finest players to ever grace a football pitch, albeit for a short time at least. Offers arrived at the Dutchman’s door but many of Europe’s top clubs were twitchy. Cruyff was a legend but had a reputation for disruption. In the days before global football coverage there were no YouTube videos to check on a player’s form and scouts were not flocking to the NASL. Cruyff wouldn’t come cheap either. While there was no transfer fee, the former Barcelona star had become accustomed to a high standard of living in the US and willing employers would need to dig deep. Many looked but didn’t touch.There had to be a short-term solution. Cruyff wanted to play at the highest level but needed game time to prove his fitness to Europe’s elite, who had decided to keep a watching brief only. With many top clubs struggling financially and reluctant to disrupt their playing staff, a short-term punt on the outspoken Cruyff didn’t make sense. Arsenal were interested in recruiting him and maintained a dialogue with the player and his agent but remained tentative, preferring a deal for the full 1981-82 season, provided Cruyff could prove he still had it first.Spanish side Levante noted Cruyff’s situation and moved quickly. The club was fourth in the Segunda División but only a point behind Racing Santander in the quest for a promotion place. An average attendance of 5,000 could easily be swelled to 20,000 once word spread north to Catalonia that Cruyff was back. Here was a chance for Barcelona fans to pay homage to a legend in the unfamiliar surroundings of Spain’s second tier. Knowing that the club could afford to pay Cruyff handsomely once promotion was assured and gate receipts counted, the Valencian outfit decided to gamble. An offer was made.In Leicester, Wallace was aware of Levante’s overtures and persuaded the directors at Filbert Street to act swiftly. Having made a huge impression on the Scotsman when destroying his Rangers team in 1973, Wallace had remained on good terms with the player and was convinced that Cruyff was the perfect solution for his struggling side. Levante had stolen a march, but Cruyff had assured Wallace via telephone that he was keen on a move to England.In the early weeks of February, 1981, Cruyff and his advisers identified three suitable offers that met the superstar’s requirements. Levante presented a return to Spain and the warm climate Cruyff enjoyed so much. Against this was the backdrop of a poor division and hard pitches grinding the joints of the ageing schemer.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Johan Cruyff in action for the Los Angeles Aztecs against the New York Cosmos in 1979. Photograph: Bob Thomas/ Getty ImagesLeicester City, on the other hand, offered the prospect of an extended winter in the East Midlands but presented the chance to cut a dash in one of Europe’s top divisions, right under the attentive gaze of Arsenal. One other offer, from an unidentified German club – possibly SV Hamburg – was also under consideration. Hamburg were determined not to be pegged back by Bayern Munich and boasted one of the best sides in the club’s history but the proud Dutchman had suffered at the hands of West Germany in the 1974 World Cup final and had no inclination to head to the Bundesliga.Saturday 7 February 1981. Still buoyant from an unlikely win over Liverpool, Leicester were back in action at Filbert Street. Manchester United in 1981 were not the latter day Manchester United of Alex Ferguson but Dave Sexton’s team still presented a difficult obstacle. However, the Filbert Street feelgood factor was in full effect and United were despatched 1-0 with Melrose again the scorer. Leicester were flying.And so it continued. A 1-0 defeat to Sunderland at Roker Park was taken on the chin and the Foxes went on to White Hart Lane. Spurs may well have been on their way to the first of consecutive FA Cup wins but Leicester beat them 2-1. Another three points for Leicester, nine out of 12 and up to 20th in the table. They were not yet safe, but momentum was building. Things reached a heady peak in the week commencing Monday 23 February 1981. European champions Nottingham Forest would be visiting Filbert Street on Saturday. Brian Clough had built a formidable side, but City were ready. Three weeks of hard negotiation were at an end. Pressed by Wallace, the Leicester board had crunched figures for weeks and made the numbers work. A quarter of gate receipts from a packed Filbert Street would be enough to cover 11 games at £4,000 per match. A staggering figure in 1980s football, this would be Cruyff’s remuneration. With the club confident a deal was past the post, the story broke in the English press and the following made the Sun newspaper on Wednesday 25 February: Johan Cruyff is today set for a sensational move to First Division strugglers Leicester City. The Dutch Master has lined up a deal worth £4,000-a-game for 11 matches and, if everything works out, he will make his debut against reigning European champions Nottingham Forest on Saturday. Last night jubilant Leicester boss Jock Wallace insisted: “Johan and I have already agreed terms. He has one or two problems to sort out, but I am very hopeful he will join us on Thursday. I would like to think that part of Johan’s interest is down to our personal friendship. I have known him since 1973 when he scored a fabulous goal for Ajax against Rangers when I was at Ibrox in the first European Super Cup. The negotiations have been going on by telephone over the past three to four weeks and now I think I have my man. He would teach my kids so much and be a great advert for Leicester City.”The story sent the city of Leicester into a tailspin. Already buzzing due to an upturn in results, and anticipating a win over local rivals Nottingham Forest, the pubs, factories, shops and offices of Leicester were alive with excited and expectant football chatter. However, by the time the Cruyff story had been digested by the football fans of the East Midlands, Levante had made a decisive move.As Jock Wallace prepared his Leicester players for the game against Forest, Cruyff was wheeling through arrivals at Valencia’s Manises airport. A month of cat-and-mouse negotiations between club and player had been concluded and a deal struck. A fixed payment, with additional increments once gate receipts were counted and promotion secured had been enough to earn his signature. Cruyff would line up for Levante the following day against Palencia CF rather than tackle Clough’s Forest. As Leicester City took to the field against their near neighbours, Cruyff spoke to the assembled Spanish press: I’m in Spain. I have signed for Levante and do not mind at all playing in the second division. The negotiations we have held for a month have been completed satisfactorily for all. I’ve decided to play for Levante because in this country I am living very well. The football is quality and the climate is also great. True, this is a second division club and it is a bit strange for a player like me, but my life is not about money or prestige. This move offers me a chance to live well, collect a large sum of pesetas, and the ability to re-enter football in Europe. I think I cannot ask more. What can I offer? My reports show clearly that the team needs a man who channels the game. I am convinced that with Levante in just 13 days we can be raised to first [in the league]. I live for each day. I am only worried about the current season. During the past two months I have had offers from Leicester, Arsenal and a German club, but I want to be free. Next season we’ll see if I renew with Levante or if I’m in the dolce vita.Newspaper reports confirm that Cruyff played in the 1-0 win over Palencia on 1 March 1981. While some deft touches were displayed, he looked every inch a stranger to his new team-mates. In the next game against Baracaldo, Cruyff only played the first 45 minutes; a stamp on his left foot rendered him unable to continue.While Cruyff was talking to the press, Leicester were drawn level 1-1 with Nottingham Forest. Recent arrival Steve Lynex had scored, but the club were unable to take the maximum points that would have lifted them out of the First Division’s bottom three. Leicester were unable to match their February form for the remainder of the season. Despite some reasonable displays, Wallace’s team won four of their remaining 12 matches, finished 21st and were relegated to the Second Division.Cruyff remained at Levante until May 1981, but struggled badly with form and fitness; a toe injury blighting the rest of his campaign. He still found time to ensure the dismissal of one coach and the selection of his own man but it didn’t work out. In the nine games that remained following Cruyff’s intervention, Levante managed only two wins. With three matches of the season remaining, they lost 3-1 at Linares and ensured that promotion was mathematically impossible.Still hampered by the toe injury he picked up against Baracaldo, Cruyff watched the game from the stands and was loudly booed by fans of both teams. Only a small amount of the original sum offered was paid by Levante and Cruyff walked away from the club after making only 10 appearances and scoring two goals.• This blog first appeared on In Bed With Maradona• Follow Jeff Livingstone and In Bed With Maradona on Twitter

Tottenham midfielder Dele Alli signs contract extension until 2021

~CONTENTS~
Dele Alli has signed a new contract to keep him at Tottenham Hotspur until 2021. The midfielder has made a huge impact since he signed from MK Dons last year for £5m, scoring five goals in 18 Premier League appearances.Dele Alli keeping feet on ground despite heroics for England against France Read moreThe 19-year-old has also broken into the England squad and scored his first international goal in the 2-0 victory over France in November.“We’re delighted to announce that Dele Alli has signed a new contract with the club which will run until 2021,” Tottenham posted on their Twitter account.Alli signed from MK Dons in January 2015 but spent the remainder of the season on loan, helping the Buckinghamshire club into the Championship.He made his Premier League debut on the opening day of this season at Manchester United and has made 25 appearances in all competitions.Having made his England Under-21 debut in September, he capped his meteoric rise by making his first senior appearance in the Euro 2016 qualifier against Estonia the following month.Alli said: “The club has been really good to me since I’ve been here. We’ve got a great young team and I’m happy to be here. All the boys and staff have helped me settled in well and made it easy to go out there and do my stuff.Dele Alli (@Dele_Alli)A lots changed in 5 years 😂😂😂 pic.twitter.com/JLyUDNbxI4January 12, 2016“That helps you with your confidence and you can focus on the football, and that’s obviously important as a young footballer moving away because it can be quite scary at times.”Spurs are fourth in the league and there is growing belief Mauricio Pochettino’s young and exciting team can mount a sustained challenge for a Champions League spot, if not for the title itself.Alli has quickly become an integral part of the Spurs team but he insists he still has much to learn as he seeks to secure his place in the England squad at Euro 2016.“I’ve got a few games now and I’ve shown what I can do and established myself as a Premier League player,” Alli said. “But I’m 19, I’ve still got a lot to learn and I can’t think of a better place to do that. When I was moving from MK, the philosophy they had as a club, it was important I found that wherever I went.“The football suits me as a player and it’s a great club to be at. Nothing changes with the contract, I’m still going to keep working hard on and off the pitch and doing as well as I can.”

The day America's top soccer club threatened to move to Mexico
~CONTENTS~
According to those who knew him, Dan Van Voorhis was a mass of contradictions – generous, gregarious and fun-loving one moment then stubborn, irascible and aggressive the next. But Van Voorhis, a man whose patronage of American professional soccer was years ahead of its time, was nothing if not bold.Bold enough, in fact, that by February 1993 he was prepared to do the unthinkable. His team, the San Francisco Bay Blackhawks, would apply for guest status in the Primera División, the highest level of professional soccer in Mexico.Such was the sorry state of professional soccer in America in 1993 that the country’s own federation president wanted to help its premier franchise gain admittance into a foreign league.“We’re having serious discussions with the Mexican Federation on the subject and I think there is a realistic possibility it could happen,” said then president of US Soccer Alan Rothenberg in a press conference. “I believe both the Blackhawks and the Mexican league are interested in testing what would be a new marketing concept.”The announcement came just one year before the US was to host the World Cup, a prerequisite of which was the development of a top-flight professional soccer league. But in 1993, a detailed conception of Major League Soccer was still some way off.When the MLS all-stars played Real Madrid: 'We got set up for failure' Read moreThe Blackhawks were a part of the American Professional Soccer League (APSL). In 1990, two separate semi-professional competitions, the Western Soccer League and the American Soccer League, merged to form the only national professional league of the era. But after only two seasons, the APSL had shrunk to just five teams, three of which played in Florida. This meant that the Blackhawks traveled further than any other team in the league, a financial strain on Van Voorhis and a physical one on the players.Still, it came as a surprise when – less than two weeks after the Blackhawks had been eliminated from the 1992 playoffs – Van Voorhis threatened to remove the team from the league entirely. His demand was simple: unless Rothenberg and US Soccer began delivering on plans to form a unified professional league, he was taking his money and his knowledge out of the game.When his threats were met mostly with silence, Van Voorhis called a press conference in to announce that his team would not play in the APSL the following season. When asked why, Van Voorhis did not mince words.“Owners of the other APSL teams are not willing to make the financial commitment to bring professional soccer in this country to a Division I level,” he declared. “I have informed Alan Rothenberg that the Blackhawks are leaving the APSL, and have petitioned US Soccer to allow us to play an independent schedule until a full Division I league is in place.”“There were not huge financial commitments [for joining the APSL],” former APSL commissioner Bill Sage told The Guardian. “It was whoever could field a credible team and get through the season and paid players at least something. It was a very eclectic group of owners, some of which had very deep pockets, and some didn’t. “Some people were pretenders around the [ownership] table that could not participate at that level and then there was Dan and maybe a handful of guys that could.”The biggest sticking point for Van Voorhis was always the lack of a professional league comparable to today’s MLS. Without one Van Voorhis knew that he was sinking his money into something that would never offer a return.“His catchphrase was like Wendy’s ‘Where’s the beef?’ He said: ‘Where’s the league? Where’s the league? I need a league to play in,’” said former Blackhawks head coach Laurie Calloway in an interview with The Guardian. “MLS was promised and promised and promised and it wasn’t happening and the World Cup was coming along and there was a deadline on getting a league together before the World Cup was awarded and Dan was right in the middle and Sepp Blatter and [the Mexican Federation officials] were the type of people he was talking to.”Van Voorhis was so dogged in his pursuit of a Division I league to play in that he routinely sent handwritten faxes to Blatter, Sage, and Rothenberg at all hours of the day. His staff even came up with a nickname for the messages, “Dan-o-grams.” While he waited for their responses, Van Voorhis began flirting with the Mexican Federation.In the 1980s and early 1990s, soccer in America was dominated by promoters, opportunistic businessmen, often acting as middlemen, who recognized early on that there were millions of people, nearly all Latino, willing to pay money to watch professional soccer. Stadium contracts – exclusive rights with stadium owners for all soccer-related events – became the most profitable currency in American soccer. Van Voorhis seethed as local promoters brought in big crowds for Mexican club friendlies at Spartan Stadium in San Jose, California.“We’re doing the work of the Lord and these promoter guys are making all the money,” former Blackhawks general manager Terry Fisher recalls Van Voorhis telling him. “Why aren’t we doing that?” Earlier in 1992, the Blackhawks had advanced to the semifinals of the Concacaf Champions’ Cup (today known as the Concacaf Champions League) where they had faced Mexican powerhouse Club América. In the second leg of the semi-final, the Blackhawks hosted América at Spartan Stadium. There, Van Voorhis watched in astonishment as more than 25,000 fans – most of them Mexican – poured through the turnstiles. The crowd dwarfed any that had ever come out to watch the Blackhawks.In May 1993, Van Voorhis finally signed his own exclusive stadium contract, this one with the San Jose State University Foundation, which gave him full control over all soccer-related events at Spartan. But within a week of signing the contract, Van Voorhis found himself the target of litigation when he tried to stop a five-game Mexican club exhibition coordinated by Imperio Productions, a local promotion company. Van Voorhis tried pointing to the contract he had just signed, but his intransigence with the promoters cost him nearly $1m in arbitration.Shortly before he died in 2005, Van Voorhis spoke with Fisher. “I don’t resent a dollar that I lost,” Fisher remembers Van Voorhis telling him. “But that $900,000 that I had to pay those fuckers broke my heart.”Despite the significant setback, Van Voorhis finally got his audience with the Mexican Federation in June. He and his front office staff traveled to Acapulco to present his plan to a gathering of Mexican club and Federation officials. He knew, or thought he knew, what would get their attention: money.“One of the biggest factors is the opportunity for [the Mexican clubs] to make money in California with how much money is here and how much Mexican support is here,” the former Blackhawks business manager Eric Yamamoto, who helped Van Voorhis put together his presentation, told The Guardian.Money, Van Voorhis had always believed, could solve any problem and overcome any obstacle. In that Van Voorhis was not entirely wrong, but he had severely underestimated the politics and culture surrounding international soccer governance.“He was totally naive to try and understand the politics of Mexican soccer,” said Fisher. “How is some lawyer from Berkeley, some 5ft 8in gringo going to live in the world of Mexican soccer?”Beyond all of the logistical issues with Van Voorhis’s plan – the travel, the transnational border crossings, the money – his timing, as it was throughout his soccer career, was all wrong. In Acapulco, the Mexican Federation was trying to mediate a pay dispute with some national team players who had already threatened to go on strike. The Blackhawks plan was tabled with no definitive timetable for a decision. The dream was dead almost as soon as it had begun and suddenly the Blackhawks had nowhere to play.Van Voorhis, however, was not yet ready to give up on his experiment. He entered the Blackhawks, now renamed the San Jose Hawks, into the United States Interregional Soccer League (USISL), a 43-team minor league operation. The Hawks picked up where the Blackhawks had left off, winning their division with ease and earning themselves a berth in the “Sizzlin’ Six,” a six-team tournament of divisional winners. But despite winning both of their tournament matches, the Hawks missed out on the final on goal differential.Having already spent an estimated $10m on the Blackhawks and with scant hope of a Division I professional league kicking off in 1994, Van Voorhis began scaling back his operation and dismantling the foundation that he had built. While he went on to play a critical role in bringing Major League Soccer to the Bay Area, Van Voorhis lacked the wherewithal to own his own franchise in the nascent league. The team that eventually kicked off in 1996, the San Jose Clash, was owned and operated by the league.Van Voorhis, the man who had kept professional soccer in the Bay Area alive in the late 80s and early 90s, could only sit and watch from his private box at Spartan Stadium as the dream he had spent so much of his own time and money trying to build manifested itself on the very field – and with many of the same coaches and players he had once employed – where he had watched his Blackhawks go toe-to-toe with some of the biggest clubs in North America.

Arsenal and Manchester City battling to sign two Nigeria youth players

~CONTENTS~
Arsenal and Manchester City are battling it out to sign two members of the Nigerian squad who won the Under-17 World Cup.Kelechi Nwakali, 17 and Samuel Chukwueze, 16, who play for Diamond Football Academy in Umuahia, southeastern Nigeria have been scouted by several of Europe’s leading clubs after both scored three goals at the World Cup in Chile in November. The playmaker Nwakali was named as the tournament’s most valuable player, while Everton have been linked with the winger Chukwueze.Reports have stated Arsenal are the favourites to sign both players for a combined £3m but according to Diamond Football Academy’s general manager, Prince Apugo, they have yet to reach a decision over their futures.“Samuel is like my son, I am his legal guardian and I have been taking good care of him for many years now. Likewise Kelechi, so naturally I would want the best for them,” Apugo told News24.“Both players have great potentials and we cannot afford to let money becloud our judgment in choosing a club for them. Our priority is their development and we are determined to ensure this is put into consideration before we accept any offers for them. Already we are deep in discussions and have gone very far with a big club with a rich history of encouraging young players and giving them chances.“At the fullness of time, when the deal is sealed the whole world will know and agree with us that we made the best choice for the players.”Bayern Munich and Belgian club Standard Liège are understood to also be interested in signing the duo, who are represented by Gareth Bale’s agents, the Stellar Group.Ballon d’Or 2015: who voted for who in this year’s poll?

Ballon d’Or 2015: who voted for whom in this year’s poll
~~AUTHOR~~
Guardian sport
~CONTENTS~
Almost 500 captains, coaches and journalists had their say in voting for Fifa’s Ballon d’Or, with Lionel Messi unsurprisingly walking away with his fifth title with an incredible share of 41.3%.That was despite once again not featuring in his great rival Cristiano Ronaldo’s top three, although the Barcelona forward also repaid the compliment to his Real Madrid counterpart. Messi picked his Barça team-mates Luis Suárez, Neymar and Andrés Iniesta, while Ronaldo sided with his club colleagues Karim Benzema, James Rodríguez and Gareth Bale.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   No Premier League players were named in Fifa’s World X1. Photograph: NIVIERE/SIPA/REX/ShutterstockThat was just one of the curiosities revealed by Fifa’s publication of how the votes were shared, with a few other eye-catching results. In particular, the Pakistan coach Mohammed Shamlan Mubarak Basheer Al Shamlan plumped for Arjen Robben despite the Bayern Munich forward having spent most of the year on the treatment table, while the Guatemala and Mauritania captains both went for Javier Mascherano.Lionel Messi: a genius and antidote to football’s bloated excesses | Barney Ronay Read moreThe Argentina defender was Roy Hodgson’s choice last year but this time the England manager placed Ronaldo first, followed by Messi and Chelsea’s Eden Hazard. The Wales manager, Chris Coleman, and his captain Ashley Williams kept things close to home by voting for Gareth Bale ahead of both Messi and Ronaldo, perhaps with his contribution to their successful Euro 2016 qualifying campaign in mind. They were joined by Drew Sherman of the Cook Islands and Brunei’s Mike Wong Mun Heng.That meant the Real Madrid forward was placed 16th, making him the only British player to finish in the top 20. Five Premier League players also made the 23-man shortlist but only two made it into the top 10 – Hazard in eighth with 1.3% of votes and Arsenal’s Alexis Sánchez in 10th. The Manchester City trio Yaya Touré, Sergio Agüero and Kevin De Bruyne finished 12th, 13th and 18th respectively.But perhaps the biggest surprise was the choice of Paul Pogba’s brother. Having been voted into the World XI, the Juventus midfielder may have felt he could rely on the support of his older sibling Florentin, who plays for Saint-Étienne. But the Guinea captain opted for Messi, Ronaldo and the Bayern Munich goalkeeper Manuel Neuer instead.

The forgotten story of … Willem ‘the Cannon’ Hesselink, Bayern's player-manager-president
~~AUTHOR~~
John Ashdown
~CONTENTS~
Wine aficionado, philosopher, crime-fighting pioneer of forensic science, national tug-of-war champion, long jump record holder, the first goalscorer for the Holland national side on home soil, Bayern Munich president, manager and player at the same time – it’s a little hard to know where to start with Willem Hesselink.International success came fairly late to the Dutch compared to their European neighbours – after making little impact at the 1934 and 1938 World Cups it was 36 years before Cruyff and co would take them back to the global stage, in which time West Germany, Austria, Hungary, England, Portugal, Italy, Czechoslovakia, France and Sweden would all visit the semi-finals or beyond – but that is not to say that the Netherlands had missed out on the great exportation of association football from British shores at the tail end of the 19th century. The Forgotten Story of … when Pelé and the Santos circus came to England Read moreIn the town of Arnhem, 60-odd miles south-east of Amsterdam, young Willem Hesselink was not immune to the new craze sweeping the continent. In 1890, aged only 12, he had been part of an attempt to get a sports club off the ground in the town and two years later he was one of the founders of Vitesse Arnhem, the gentlemen planners plumping for the French word for “speed” as their prefix. Cricket was the initial activity of choice but football took over quickly and Hesselink was soon the star of the team.The beginnings, though, were not particularly auspicious. “Nobody had a particular place in the team,” wrote Hesselink later. “Each player was asked in which position he would prefer to play. I replied: ‘I do not care,” which meant, of course, I was placed in the least preferred place, left-winger.” The young Hesselink used the inconvenience to his advantage, working hard to make his left foot as skilful as his right.It was not necessarily his skill, however, for which he became known. Throughout the 1890s, first with Vitesse and then with HVV Den Haag when he moved to Leiden to study chemistry, he developed a reputation for a fearsomely powerful shot. Vitesse’s official history notes that goalkeepers would be “risking a broken wrist” when they attempted to save his attempts on goal and there is some talk of an English goalkeeper suffering a fatal injury after taking a Hesselink shot full on the chest, although this seems, thankfully, to be apocryphal. Nevertheless, the nickname “Het Kanon” – “The Cannon” – stuck.Regional championship medals followed but Hesselink’s successes were not restricted solely to the football field. He won the Dutch national long jump and 1500m titles – his national long jump record stood until 1910 – and with several of his Vitesse team-mates he was the national champion in tug-of-war (at the time an Olympic sport).       Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Tug-of-war was an Olympic sport at the turn of the century. Here a combined Sweden/Denmark team take on France at the 1900 Games in Paris. Photograph: Popperfoto/Getty ImagesIn 1902, however, Hesselink was ready for pastures new, switching the cycle ride from Leiden to Den Haag for matches and training for life in Bavaria. The now 24-year-old Hesselink signed up to continue his studies at Ludwig Maximilians University in Munich and looked around for a new club to join. Handily, there was a club in its infancy in the area, only two years old and in need of a bit of leadership. Bayern grew out of the football division of the gymnastics club, MTV 1879, 11 footballers having walked out in 1900 when the club refused to allow them to join the southern German league.Hesselink became Bayern’s first international star. Countless others have followed – from Brian Laudrup to Robert Lewandowski – but the Dutchman was the first. The club’s games were restricted to regional and city-based competitions but they became increasingly successful, in no small part because of Hesselink’s influence at centre-forward, and by 1903 he was coaching the rest of Bayern’s young squad, and helping to bring more players into the club.In 1903 Franz John, instigator of that 1900 revolt against the gymnasts and Bayern Munich’s first president, left the club to return to his home town of Pankow and set up a photo studio. There was an obvious choice for his successor: the man from Arnhem who would rarely be seen without his blue woollen cap.It’s fair to point out that the role of president in those days was not exactly the all-powerful position it is today and the job of coach/manager not as clearly defined as it might be now – as it was more concerned with day-to-day organising than big business – but Hesselink remains one of only two men to have held all three positions – the other is Franz Beckenbauer – and certainly the only one to hold all three positions simultaneously. In Hesselink’s time at the club, Bayern won three successive city championships, which included teams from Nürnberg and Augsburg, although was a fairly minor affair, and, perhaps most significantly, merged with Münchner Sport Club, a move that resulted in Bayern adopting red as their main shirt colour.In May 1905 Hesselink, who had played for Dutch representative sides throughout the late 1890s, made his international debut in Holland’s second official fixture – and their first on home soil – scoring the opening goal against Belgium in a 4-0 win in front of 30,000 in Rotterdam. His studies, though, had begun to grow in importance. In June 1904 he had won a doctorate for a dissertation on the port wines of the Douro region – he was known as De Dokter as well as his Het Kanon sobriquet – and would later add a doctorate of philosophy to his CV. His interest in food chemistry morphed into an interest in forensic science. A year later he married Berta Güttler in Frankfurt, where he would later perhaps meet, or maybe simply get to know the work of: the sources aren’t entirely clear, Georg Popp, the Frankfurt scientist who in October 1904 is credited as being the first person to solve a crime through forensic geology.In January 1906 Hesselink left Munich, leaving a club that had grown considerably in his time at the helm in the hands of Kurt Müller, and returned to the Netherlands, setting up a forensic laboratory and building a reputation as a leading exponent of blood analysis and fingerprints in criminal cases, and becoming a regular expert witness in murder trials.When he wasn’t starring in CSI: Arnhem, Hesselink continued his footballing career, rejoining Vitesse and later becoming coach, treasurer and president. He died in December 1973, having crammed an awful lot into his 95 years and written his name into a small but significant part of European football history.

He is due to travel north for talks and a medical on Tuesday.The England international, who joined Swansea from Liverpool for £5m in 2013, is set to be the first player to leave since Alan Curtis became the interim manager after Garry Monk’s sacking.Shelvey returned to the side at the weekend after falling out of favour under Curtis, only to be involved in a dispute with his own supporters after Swansea were knocked out of the FA Cup by League Two Oxford.At the final whistle in the 3-2 defeat his applause for the visiting support turned into an angry gesture when he was met with abuse.The manager said: “I saw him go over to the fans and I thought everything was OK. The suggestion is some of the crowd were having a go at him but I genuinely did not see that.”

Liverpool’s search for central defensive reinforcement has led them to Queens Park Rangers defender Steven Caulker, who has now finalised a loan move to Anfield.Caulker was a season-long loan at Southampton but failed to establish himself in Ronald Koeman’s side and last played for the club in December’s 6-1 defeat by Liverpool in the Capital One Cup quarter-final.David Squires on … football's proposed trials of video replays Read moreQPR have accepted Liverpool’s offer of a loan deal until the end of the season and Caulker returned to Loftus Road on Tuesday to officially cancel his terms with Southampton. The 24-year-old was registered by noon, meaning he will be eligible to play for Liverpool against Arsenal in the Premier League on Wednesday. The former Tottenham Hotspur and Cardiff City defender could train with Jürgen Klopp’s squad at Melwood later on Tuesday.“Liverpool Football Club have completed the signing of Steven Caulker on loan from Queens Park Rangers until the end of the season,” read a statement on Liverpool’s website.“The relevant paperwork has been completed in time to allow the centre-back to be eligible for selection for Wednesday evening’s Barclays Premier League fixture with Arsenal at Anfield.“Caulker, who has Premier League experience as well as being capped by England, showed a willingness to commit to the Reds at short notice.”His arrival eases the injury situation the club are currently facing in defence, which includes both short and long-term absentees.Klopp lost all four of his established central defenders to injury for Friday’s FA Cup tie at Exeter City – Martin Skrtel, Dejan Lovren, Mamadou Sakho and Kolo Touré .

Wes Morgan is Leicester’s lucky charm in search of Premier League dream
~~AUTHOR~~
Barney Ronay
~CONTENTS~
With Leicester in town this was never likely to be a free-scoring occasion. In the last month Claudio Ranieri’s team haven’t really gone in for goals at either end. Still it felt like a match that was likely to showcase the qualities of English football’s current top guns Harry Kane and Jamie Vardy, scorers of 26 league goals between them and in direct opposition here as Vardy started the match after his groin surgery.Claudio Ranieri laughs off Leicester City title talk after win Read moreIn the end, though, as Leicester went joint-top of the Premier League with a sweaty, thrillingly tight 1-0 victory it seemed fitting the night’s dominant presence should be a 31-year-old rumbling buffalo of a central defender who 10 years ago was playing in League One with Nottingham Forest.Wes Morgan has enjoyed a late-blooming Premier League second life with Leicester. It has been bumpy at times. This season, though, has been a quiet revelation, Morgan evolving toward his current plateau of muscular, poised close-range excellence in a team that again played to his strengths here, condensing around him as Spurs attacked like infantrymen rallying to their standard.It had seemed likely to be a tough task for Morgan here with Kane on a fine scoring run. With Vardy back for Leicester there was a temptation before kick-off to see only the contrast between the two strikers, their different routes to the same spot, Premier League princeling versus non-league arriviste. Often overlooked, however, is the fact Vardy, Kane and Morgan too were team-mates three years ago. Kane and Vardy shared a bench, and occasionally the pitch all the way to the play-offs where Leicester lost their semi-final to Watford. Troy Deeney scored the winner that day in a Championship game that featured the current top three English Premier League goalscorers.If this was an unforgivingly tight 90 minutes, with Leicester taking Spurs in a deep-blue headlock from the start, it was still a match to shine a light on the bracing social mobility at work this season. The Premier League often takes a beating for its disconnect from the tiers below, but this was in many ways a match to restore some faith in the idea of development and progress through the levels. Leicester fielded six starting players who were in the Championship two seasons ago. Spurs’ team had two players who have made a genuine step up from the Football League, plus six who have benefited from time spent there.Leicester stun Tottenham thanks to Robert Huth’s late header Read moreVardy and Kane are among these, although in the end neither really prospered in a match where the action was compressed into a narrow block of blue and white 10 yards deep in either half. Kane had entered this game with 13 goals in his last 14 games, while Vardy has taken a breath in the last month. That starburst of scoring form, the sense of some unstoppable, roving blue-sleeved alien goal-goblin loose among the pampered earthling defences was always likely to come to a halt, not least in a team that broke a four-hour goal drought here. Vardy was at least a constant harrying menace for 70 minutes as Leicester sat close to their own goal, unafraid simply to defend, while Spurs probed and picked at that deep blue double-bolt.And so it carried on as a claustrophobic match moved scoreless into the second half. Vardy had the first close-range sight of goal, taking Marc Albrighton’s bobbled cross and seeing his shot blocked by – of all people – Kane. Otherwise England’s current No1 centre-forward struggled here, buffeting against Morgan pretty much constantly for an hour and a half.It must be said, Morgan was wonderful. Error prone at times last season, he has evolved into a restrained colossus of the Leicester backline. Here he managed Kane as much with his upper body as his legs, that vast, double-helping frame shadowing him everywhere, invading his space, swallowing the air around him.Leicester’s Jamie Vardy makes history to show the pest is the best | Stuart James Read moreAs the game moved into its final knockings it was fitting a Leicester defender should score the winner. It was Robert Huth who got it, given the time and space at a corner to bend his back and butt the ball back past Hugo Lloris. Morgan had played his own small part, churning his way forward at the last moment to occupy a defender as Spurs were drawn into his orbit at the near post.There is an ongoing fascination at Leicester with Morgan’s failure to draw a booking in the league, a sequence that goes back to April last year. Perhaps in the end it isn’t Vardy’s goals but Morgan’s yellow card vigil that has been the lucky charm, the ravens in the tower as that stellar run just carries on: this was his 34th game without a booking.At the final whistle Morgan went across to grin and wave with the Leicester fans, captain of a team at the top of the league in January. It felt like a moment to appreciate the journey from there to here, and a player who embodies more than most this thrillingly insubordinate season.

Aleksandar Mitrovic says he is gaining confidence at Newcastle United
~~AUTHOR~~
Ed Aarons
~CONTENTS~
Newcastle’s Aleksandar Mitrovic is hoping his performance in the 3-3 draw against Manchester United showed he is taking more responsibility since his £13m move from Anderlecht last summer.Having set up Georginio Wijnaldum for Newcastle’s opening goal in the first half, the Serbia striker won and scored a penalty to make it 2-2 and then had a hand in Paul Dummett’s late equaliser which denied Louis van Gaal’s side victory.It was a timely intervention for a player who spent the first months of his Newcastle career struggling to settle. Sent off against Arsenal at the end of August in only his fourth match, the 21-year-old scored against Tottenham on 13 December and has been an important part of Newcastle’s improvedform over the past few weeks.“Scoring will do a lot for my confidence. I needed that goal, you can see that in my celebration. I was really happy. It is good for my confidence and I hope I will keep scoring,” Mitrovic said.Pavel Srnicek memorial: Newcastle players, staff and fans pay tribute Read more“I am getting better each game. It’s difficult each game. Defenders are getting stronger. Maybe a few games and more time to adapt. Every game is different. It is different football to what I played in Belgium. It is a difficult time and maybe that is behind me. Every game I feel better and I have more confidence.”Having completed the signing of Jonjo Shelvey from Swansea for £12m on Tuesday, Newcastle are also in the market for a new striker, with Papiss Cissé set to be sidelined for a month after groin surgery. They have been linked with moves for Alexandre Lacazette of Lyon and Toulouse’s Wissam Ben Yedder but Mitrovic insisted he is not unduly concerned by the speculation. “I don’t read newspapers. I am here to play,” he said. “I played good in the last few games. I have been unlucky. The goals will come.”Tuesday’s game was the second time since Mitrovic’s arrival in England that he has come up against Wayne Rooney. After the final whistle, he sought out the England captain to swap shirts and believes Rooney can continue to play at the highest level for another 10 years, dismissing criticism of him as “crazy”.“I took the shirt from Rooney after – it is really amazing. He is a legend,” Mitrovic said. “I hope maybe one day I can be like Wayne Rooney. Some young players will be proud to play against me. It is amazing. You can see on the pitch how easy he moves and how easy he plays. He is a good player.”Asked whether Rooney is finished, Mitrovic added: “They are crazy. They are people who don’t watch football. If he doesn’t score in a few games the team don’t play well, he cannot play well. You can see on the pitch the way he plays during the whole game, how easy he plays. I think he can play 10 years more.”

Jores Okore: Aston Villa can pull off great escape like Leicester did
~~AUTHOR~~
Stuart James
~CONTENTS~
Jores Okore believes Aston Villa are capable of pulling off what would go down as the Premier League’s greatest escape, provided they can follow up their first win since the opening day of the season with two victories against Leicester City and West Bromwich Albion.Aston Villa finally seal home league win thanks to Crystal Palace keeper Read moreSpeaking after Villa defeated Crystal Palace on Tuesday to end a winless run in the league that stretched back to early August, Okore refused to accept relegation is a foregone conclusion and said “everything seems possible” if they beat Leicester and Albion. Although that will be easier said than done for a team who remain anchored to the foot of the table, there was no escaping the change in the mood at Villa Park on the back of the 1-0 victory over Palace.Okore spoke about the way Leicester spectacularly turned around their season last year when they won seven of their last nine league games to climb off the bottom and pull clear, and said Villa’s players needed to take inspiration from that achievement. “They did really well last year. If they can do it, we need to believe we can do it too,” the Villa defender said.Asked whether he believes Villa can still survive, Okore replied: “We all believe we can do it. We wouldn’t be here otherwise. Against Palace we showed we can work hard, and we have the belief we can get on a run now with two big games coming up. If we get something against those two teams then everything seems possible.”The poor performance against Wycombe Wanderers in the FA Cup on Saturday proved to be a tipping point for Villa supporters, who were angry with events on as well as off the field. Brad Guzan and Joleon Lescott, who scored the winning goal against Palace, are alleged to have sworn at Villa fans and there was mutiny in the air at the end of that 1-1 draw, with Rémi Garde also coming under fire.Okore admitted the players’ pride has been hurt during an abysmal run of results and also said it has taken time to adapt to Garde’s methods since he replaced Tim Sherwood as manager in November.“It hasn’t been easy with the change of manager. It can take a little time for the players to buy into the system and get used to the system and what the manager wants us to do,” he said. “We’re getting a bit more comfortable in what the manager wants from us and that’s paying off now.”The bottom line, though, is that Villa still need to produce an extraordinary run of results – bordering on a football miracle in the context of their season so far – to have a chance of staying up. “I don’t know about miracles but it’d be a really big thing,” Okore said. “It’s something that won’t be forgotten in a hurry if we stay up. This situation is not easy. I hope we can stay up and people won’t forget how we fought to do it in the last part of the season to show we belong in this league.”

Hull’s Abel Hernández hits the spot to spark victory over Cardiff
~CONTENTS~
Goals from Abel Hernández and Sam Clucas propelled Hull back into second spot in the Championship and increased the pressure on the Cardiff manager, Russell Slade.The embarrassing FA Cup exit to League One strugglers Shrewsbury had reportedly left Slade on the brink, with online polls showing many Cardiff fans want a new manager.The pressure on Slade will only increase after an uninspiring display at Hull, who usurped Derby with a win more comfortable than the scoreline suggests.It was a 10th home win of the season for Steve Bruce’s men and a result that always looked likely after Anthony Pilkington clipped over Cardiff’s best chance midway through the first half.Hernández’s penalty five minutes before the break give Hull an advantage they would not relinquish, with Clucas volleying home the hosts’ second shortly after the restart to wrap up victory.It was meek response to the 1-0 home defeat to Shrewsbury and a result that looked likely once Hull found their feet, with Bruno Ecuele Manga denying the dilly-dallying Hernández an early opener.Charlton Athletic sack interim manager Karel Fraeye Read moreDavid Marshall should have been tested at the very least and the same went for Mo Diamé shortly afterwards, with his curling effort flying well over the Cardiff goal.Only a timely Matthew Connolly block prevented Hernandez directing home an exceptional Clucas cross as City continued to control proceedings, with Cardiff finally mustering their first attempt after 27 minutes.A wonderfully-weighted ball from Craig Noone put Pilkington through on goal and the winger’s clipped effort rippled the net, only for it to quickly dawn on the travelling support it had landed on top of the goal.It was a great chance that Slade’s men were made to rue five minutes before half-time, when Lee Peltier wrestled Harry Maguire to the ground from a corner. Scott Duncan pointed to the spot and Hernández converted, hitting a powerful effort out of Marshall’s reach.Hull’s lead never looked in danger from that point onwards and Marshall did well to prevent the impressive Maguire scoring an unlikely effort at the far post shortly after half-time.Clucas’ free-kick created that danger and the winger himself soon added Hull’s second, keeping composed after his initial effort ballooned off a defender to volley home low past Marshall.Pilkington and Joe Ralls had efforts on rare voyages forward as Cardiff attempted to peg back Hull, but nearly went further behind when Diamé and Hernández linked up. Marshall did well to deny Clucas when Hull next attacked and substitute Tom Huddlestone twice tried his luck from distance.Marshall again denied Clucas in stoppage time and, much to the relief of the 162 visiting fans, prevented David Meyler making it three with the last effort of the match.

Liverpool and Arsenal draw thriller after Firmino and Giroud doubles
~~AUTHOR~~
Daniel Taylor
~CONTENTS~
Every year, there are certain matches when the team who go on to win the Premier League can look back and identify key moments in the title race, when everything falls into place and they show all the qualities that champions need. For Arsenal, it had been tantalisingly close to being one of those games, taking control under the Anfield floodlights, in front of a baying crowd, and heading towards a victory that would have represented a compelling statement of their ambitions.Leicester stun Tottenham thanks to Robert Huth’s late header Read moreThe disappointment for Arsène Wenger’s team was considerable given there was still one late, dramatic twist to a wild and enthralling night of attacking football. Arsenal had fought back from going behind on two separate occasions during that blitz of four goals in a pulsating 15-minute period of the first half. Roberto Firmino scored both of them for Liverpool and Wenger’s men had to show all their competitive courage before Olivier Giroud’s second goal gave them the lead for the first time. Aaron Ramsey had fired in the first equaliser and Giroud, playing as well as at any time in his Arsenal career, ran the line with great expertise, skill and courage.Yet Liverpool had played with a wonderful sense of adventure, too. The two sides have now accumulated 41 goals between them in their last 10 encounters but, for Arsenal, the last of them was a grievous setback, coming off the right boot of Joe Allen just as the electronic scoreboard in the corner of the Kop was ticking towards stoppage time. Allen’s volley was taken with control, running on to a header from another substitute, Christian Benteke, and firing his shot into the bottom corner to spare Liverpool a home defeat.It was a breathless, raucous night and, by the end, it felt like a trick of the mind that Liverpool had gone into this match having never scored fewer goals at the corresponding stage of a league season. Klopp’s men were quick to the ball, moving it with speed and confidence and, finally, Firmino has shown Anfield the qualities that persuaded the club to spend £29m on him last summer.Firmino had scored only once in his first 24 appearances since joining from Hoffenheim but this was the night when the Brazilian introduced himself properly. His second goal, in particular, was a beauty. Twenty-five yards out, Firmino went for a curler and delivered his shot with just the right amount of bend to put the ball into the top corner of Petr Cech’s net.Liverpool had taken the lead in the 10th minute when Theo Walcott committed the cardinal sin of trying to dribble the ball out of his own penalty area rather than attempting to clear his lines. Walcott was suddenly surrounded by players in red, lost the ball and Arsenal were immediately vulnerable. Emre Can had the first shot and, though Cech parried it away, Firmino seized on the rebound, turned the ball on to his left foot and scored with a low shot that went through Laurent Koscielny’s legs to wrong-foot Arsenal’s goalkeeper.Klopp’s team pinned their opponents back throughout the opening exchanges but their problem was in defence where they looked susceptible far too often. Joel Campbell was a difficult opponent for Alberto Moreno. Walcott seemed determined to make amends for his earlier mistake and Mesut Özil was prominently involved without being at his most exhilarating.Manchester City frustrated by Everton and Sterling’s late penalty claim Read moreMore than anyone, Giroud took the game to Liverpool. He needed his head to be stapled after taking a bang from Mamadou Sakho in the first half but it was typical of how he played that, in winning that aerial challenge, he had helped to set up Ramsey’s goal. Giroud made it 2-2 with an improvisational flick to deceive Simon Mignolet from a corner to the near post and his next goal, 10 minutes into the second half, was another mix of high skill and confidence.The French striker had his back to goal when he latched on to Campbell’s pass but he spun expertly, despite the close proximity of a couple of defenders, and swept a swivelling left-foot shot into the far corner.The disappointment for Liverpool at half-time was the way they had been pegged back so quickly after Firmino’s goals. Campbell’s beautifully weighted pass set up Ramsey four minutes after they had gone behind, and it was another quick response from Wenger’s team when Firmino curled in Liverpool’s second. Wenger cannot have been satisfied with the number of chances Liverpool created but this was a night that told us something about Arsenal’s spirit. Unfortunately for them, they were facing a team forbidden from accepting defeat lightly.The rain and sleet was so heavy at the end that leaks started to appear in the roof of the old Main Stand and so much water began to cascade down that various suites had to be closed off afterwards. Liverpool roused themselves on a greasy surface and perhaps Arsenal were guilty of defending too deeply as the home team started to aim long balls into the penalty area and Klopp brought on his new loan signing, Steven Caulker, as an emergency striker. Allen applied the final flourish and Arsenal, so close to a crucial victory, will have to hope that moment does not have lasting ramifications come the end of the season.

Manchester City frustrated by Everton and Sterling’s late penalty claim
~~AUTHOR~~
Jamie Jackson
~CONTENTS~
This was a match of supreme frustration for Manchester City summed up in the final seconds when Raheem Sterling was felled by John Stones inside the penalty area only for Roger East, the referee, to fail to point at the spot.This had Manuel Pellegrini’s team and supporters in uproar but while an injustice, given the chances spurned, City should have already sealed victory.They failed to score at home for the first time in nearly a year, the last occasion being a 2-0 FA Cup defeat to Middlesbrough on 24 January 2015. It meant their domination of Everton ended in the dropping of what may prove crucial points in this wide-open title race.Manchester City 0-0 Everton: Premier League – as it happened Read moreOf the Sterling penalty claim, Pellegrini said: “I don’t think I need to give my thoughts about that action. The whole stadium could see it was a penalty. It was so clear, so near for the referee and both legs of Raheem were taken and it was a clear foul from Stones. But if the referee doesn’t whistle for it, we can’t say anything about that.”Roberto Martínez offered a bullish take on the incident, seeming to suggest Sterling was hoping to deceive the referee into awarding the kick. “The way I saw it live and I haven’t seen the replay, I saw John Stones go to ground to block the trajectory of the ball, the direction of the ball. All of a sudden, Raheem Sterling is quite happy not to play the ball and he wants to invite some sort of a contact. Not long ago we were on the receiving end of a really poor decision right at the end in the last minute against Stoke.”The Everton manager was referring to a Marko Arnautovic penalty in Everton’s 4-3 defeat at Goodison Park. “It was the wrong decision at that time. What you want as a manager is a referee that is 100% when he gives that sort of decision.”Pellegrini had felt unable to start David Silva, who was a substitute, so he asked Sterling to operate at No10, Jesús Navas was on the right and the disappointing Kevin De Bruyne on the left.The Sterling-De Bruyne partnership was lively. The England man won the opening corner which was taken by the Belgian, though it came to nothing. Later they combined as De Bruyne sprinted into the area from Sterling’s pass in what was a second warning to the visitors.Everton arrived with only three away victories but on the half-hour Leon Osman suggested they had no fear of the Etihad. Romelu Lukaku chipped a ball in from the right and Osman let go a sweet left-foot volley that went narrowly wide.After creating this chance Lukaku showed why he is the League’s joint top scorer, with 15 goals. Stones sliced City open with a pass along the right and the centre-forward sprinted into the area but as he shot Nicolás Otamendi did enough to put off the Belgian.The best goals of the week: Paul Pogba, Sergio Agüero and Barry Bannan Read moreAlthough neither manager made a substitution at the interval Pellegrini tinkered with his personnel, swapping the positions of De Bruyne and Sterling. If he hoped for a dividend from the latter’s pace down the left he came close to an instant yield. Taking the ball along the corridor Sterling’s speed allowed him to tear towards Tim Howard but the attempt was a disappointment, so off target it came closer to being a throw-in than to giving City the lead.Yaya Touré’s form has enjoyed a recent upturn and a buccaneering run and shot that forced a corner again showed the force he can be for City. De Bruyne, who previously scuffed a delivery from the right, this time aimed better as it came at Sergio Agüero at speed and the No10’s header needed the excellent Howard to be sharp to repel it.This was now City’s best passage of play. Sterling again might have taken himself into double figures for City this season but he could not convert. Next up, De Bruyne had a cross-cum-shot that came to nothing.After Martínez brought on Steven Pienaar and Arouna Koné for Osman and Gerard Deulofeu, Pellegrini made his own move. De Bruyne was replaced by Silva, the manager looking for the player he views as City’s X-factor to fashion a third league victory in four outings. But the player nicknamed “Merlin” could not affect the outcome. City probed but could not find the ruthless edge required. They will hope not to look back with regret at this come the end of the season.Pellegrini had to concede this had been a missed opportunity to close the gap with the leaders. “Yes of course. Not because you play at home and you drop points, it’s because we had a lot of merit, especially during the second half, to win this game, in a clear way. But for different reasons we couldn’t score. But we have another 17 games and the important thing is to try to continue in the way we are.“I am happy about the performance, although I am disappointed with the result. But nothing is finished yet.”

Leicester stun Tottenham thanks to Robert Huth’s late header
~~AUTHOR~~
David Hytner
~CONTENTS~
There has been a slightly haughty presumption that has tracked Leicester City on their wild ride and it goes something like this – Claudio Ranieri’s underdogs will, at some point, fade away. They have to, simply because this sort of thing does not happen. It should not happen. It cannot happen.But it is very much happening and matches like this prove Leicester are not only top-four material but they are in with a shout of the biggest prize. Their style is a case study in ruthless simplicity and it achieved the latest beautiful result of their fairytale season when Robert Huth, criminally unmarked inside the area on Christian Fuch’s late corner, directed a firm header back inside the near top corner of Hugo Lloris’s net.Leicester did what they have done all season: they stayed solid, they went toe-to-toe with supposedly better heeled opposition and, when the moments presented themselves, they struck with venom – quickly and directly.They had flickered, most notably through Jamie Vardy, who was back with indecent haste after groin surgery, and the substitute Leonardo Ulloa but it was Huth, with his first goal of the season, who was the unlikely matchwinner. Leicester had drawn blanks in their previous three league games but Huth’s goal was glorious on so many levels, not least in its timing.Tottenham Hotspur were fired up and for what this game meant to them, no one needed to look any further than the figure in the dark coat on the touchline. Mauricio Pochettino tends to exist on an even keel; the club’s manager rarely gets too high or too low. But here, he lived every breath of a frenetic struggle. Passionately.Liverpool and Arsenal draw thriller after Firmino and Giroud doubles Read moreIt was difficult to remember him being so animated during a game and it seemed to reflect the awareness that here was a golden opportunity for Tottenham to make a statement about their top-four aspirations; to reel in one of their rivals.Pochettino paced his technical area throughout; he bellowed his instructions and his criticisms, and he howled at the heavens when the big chances went begging or, more precisely, Kasper Schmeichel, the Leicester goalkeeper, made a series of inspired interventions.Schmeichel’s best moment came in the 62nd minute and, in some respects, it was the turning point of the game. Erik Lamela had slipped Harry Kane clean through with a cute pass and the striker’s shot reared up off Schmeichel but ricocheted to safety off the crossbar.It was Huth and Leicester who made the statement and the wackiness of it all was summed up by the chants towards the end from the visiting supporters. “We are staying up,” they chorused before, in the next breath, they were rather more bold. “We’re gonna win the league,” they yelled.This was Part II of a trilogy, following Sunday’s 2-2 draw here in the FA Cup – the replay is next Wednesday – and it was another absorbing affair, with Tottenham starting with the greater intensity. For 15 minutes or so, Leicester could not live with their pressing.The home team’s lively start had featured a low Dele Alli blast that fizzed wide and a downward header from Toby Alderweireld, following a Lamela corner, that bounced up and looked bound for the top of the net. Schmeichel threw out a hand to tip it over. Christian Eriksen would also work the Leicester goalkeeper on the half hour from outside the area.Leicester enjoyed a purple patch midway through the first half, which was sparked when a mix-up between Kyle Walker and Lloris led to a chance for Shinji Okazaki, who dragged his shot wide. Okazaki almost got in again moments later, following a jet-heeled burst by N’Golo Kanté only for Alderweireld to stick out a boot while Danny Drinkwater drew a fine save out of Lloris with a well-executed volley.Manchester City frustrated by Everton and Sterling’s late penalty claim Read moreIt was relentlessly hectic and, for long spells, as the tackles flew in, the creative talents gasped for room. Vardy sparked in the second half. He reacted inside a congested area to unload at goal and only a block by Kane, of all people, denied him. There was also the moment on the hour when he stole into the area only to be cleaned out by Lloris, who took both ball and man. There were strangled Leicester cries for a penalty.Tottenham had their chances after the interval. From Ben Davies’s cross, Lamela had a big one, on his left foot, only to scuff his shot and watch it squirm past the far post, via a deflection. Kane was denied by Schmeichel on the biggest of them all while Alli, too, was thwarted by the goalkeeper.But, after Ulloa had seen an effort blocked by Jan Vertonghen, amid an almighty scramble, the scene was set for Huth. Leicester march on.

~CONTENTS~
When the dust settles on this extraordinary match – and that could take a while – the referee will cease to become the main talking point for Swansea City and the threat of relegation will start to bite. Graham Scott, who was asked to take charge of the game at short notice after Andre Marriner pulled out on Monday, looked totally out of his depth at this level, yet the erroneous decisions that impacted on both teams were of little concern to Sunderland come the end.Inspired by the evergreen Jermain Defoe, who completed his hat-trick five minutes from time and took his tally to five in two games in the process, Sunderland picked up the most precious of victories to move within one point of Swansea and give their survival hopes a huge boost.It was a crazy, helter-skelter game and one that was overshadowed by some calamitous refereeing from a man who was officiating only his fourth Premier League game. Defoe looked to be offside when he gave Sunderland a third-minute lead and it should not have been a penalty when Wes Brown was penalised for fouling André Ayew later in the first half.Then came arguably the defining moment in the match when Scott sent off Kyle Naughton in the 37th minute for a challenge on Yann M’Vila that was not worthy of a free-kick never mind a straight red card. The full-back’s studs were high but he clearly got the ball and only M’Vila knows why he was rolling around.Although that harsh decision initially galvanised Swansea, who went 2-1 ahead through a superb Ayew goal shortly before the interval, Sunderland’s numerical advantage eventually told. Patrick van Aanholt, who was excellent on the left flank, hauled Sunderland level with a deflected shot and from that point on it was all about Defoe.Alan Curtis, Swansea’s interim manager, was bitterly upset and felt Scott’s decision to send off Naughton was the turning point. “I’m disappointed. I think the big talking point is the referee’s decisions,” Curtis said. “I won’t say it has cost us as you don’t know how it will play out but it has had a major bearing on the game. Unfortunately the referee did look out of his depth.“We were fortuitous with the penalty decision for us. But when he makes a huge decision to send a player off we were forced to play the next hour with 10. You only have to look at the video and Kyle won the ball cleanly. It is something we will try to appeal in the morning.”Allardyce had some sympathy for Swansea and Naughton on that occasion – he looked across at Curtis and appeared bemused as well as amused when Scott showed a red card – but he also made the point Sunderland were on the wrong end of a bad call with the Ayew penalty incident.“Scott only stepped in because the referee who was supposed to referee the game was ill,” the Sunderland manager said. “In his defence before the game Scott pointed out: ‘I know how big this game is for both of you and I’ll try and manage it the best way I can.’ But things happen under pressure and when people are under pressure they make mistakes.”The referee was not the only one who blundered. Lukasz Fabianski’s terrible goalkick led to Sunderland’s opener when he drilled the ball straight to Adam Johnson, who fed Fabio Borini on the left. Borini’s low shot was parried by Fabianski and Defoe, who had strayed into an offside position, tapped home.Gylfi Sigurdsson levelled from the spot after Scott deemed Brown had tripped Ayew when the Ghanaian had actually stubbed his foot into the ground. Three minutes after Naughton’s dismissal Swansea were in front when Ayew, sprinting on to Fabianski’s measured kick, beat Lee Cattermole and struck home a sumptuous left-foot angled drive that flashed into the far corner.With an extra man, Allardyce urged his players to press higher up the pitch in the second half and Sunderland quickly got reward when Van Aanholt cut inside and thumped an 18-yard shot that took a wicked deflection off Federico Fernández’s back and went in off the far upright. Defoe, running on to Johnson’s fine pass, then beat Fabianski to grab his second – again the striker appeared offside – before later turning in Van Aanholt’s cut-back for his third.“Jermain’s a massive player for us and converted most of the chances we created,” Allardyce said. “And irrespective of some of the referee’s decisions we’ve gone and won away in an enormous game for both of us because we’ve gained three points on everybody that is above.”

West Brom’s James McClean checks Chelsea revival with late leveller
~~AUTHOR~~
James Riach
~CONTENTS~
Chelsea remain unbeaten under Guus Hiddink but this heated match on a cold night ended in much frustration for the champions. West Bromwich Albion had riled both the crowd and Diego Costa, while James McClean’s late goal ensured they stay three points clear of Hiddink’s side in the bottom half of the table.Chelsea given smaller PSG ticket allocation due to Paris security fear Read moreCosta flew into a challenge at the start of the second half and was furious at the final whistle, following a match where West Brom twice pulled level. The Spain forward appeared to hit out at the tunnel after the final whistle following an attempt to confront the opposition goalkeeper, Boaz Myhill, on the pitch.Chelsea showed glimpses of their old self, producing a fair number of chances with Costa moving well up front, but defensive concerns remain and West Brom deserved a point. César Azpilicueta had given the home side the lead – scoring only his second league goal, both against Albion – but twice they were pulled back. Craig Gardner equalised in the first half before McClean cancelled out Gareth McAuley’s own goal with four minutes remaining.“At the end I think it’s a fair result although in the first half after 1-0 we had a few chances to go 2-0, which didn’t happen,” said Hiddink. “Then we conceded an unfortunate goal and let them penetrate too easily. It was a very entertaining game, high speed and intensity from both sides.”On Costa’s frenetic night, he joked: “We can repair that [the tunnel] easily. He’s an emotional guy and I like that very much.”It was the referee, Anthony Taylor, who was the subject of Chelsea supporters’ ire, with Albion taking their time at set pieces and throw-ins throughout the match. Jonas Olsson was one of three changes Tony Pulis made from Albion’s previous league match, the 2-1 win over Stoke City, Salomón Rondón starting up front with McClean in an attacking three behind him, while Pedro replaced the injured Eden Hazard for Chelsea.Costa did well to control and hold up a direct ball after 20 minutes, laying off to Willian who fed Branislav Ivanovic wide on the right. The full-back’s low cross evaded all the men in red and the masked Azpilicueta came flying in at the far post to muscle in and finish.The lead lasted only 13 minutes, however. Gardner, who had been brought on for the injured James Morrison in the seventh minute, received the ball in a central attacking position after Pedro had dawdled in possession on the left, following good hustling from McClean. Gardner took one touch before shooting low into the bottom corner from 25 yards, puncturing the earlier optimism. The half ended with the crowd becoming increasingly frustrated, while Costa berated Taylor after he blew for half-time when Chelsea were poised to launch a counterattack.The ill-feeling on the pitch grew as the game wore on, home supporters vexed by West Brom’s time-wasting. Things did not get easier for the referee either. In the 49th minute Costa, so annoyed before half-time, flew in late and at pace on Gardner, but the challenge resulted in only a yellow card.Chelsea’s Baba Rahman: I’ve had enough of sitting in the stands Read moreAs the noise increased and the rain began to fall, Chelsea broke swiftly down the left through the substitute Kenedy, who had been brought on by Hiddink to replace Pedro. As the 19-year-old carried the ball forward, Costa was tripped by Claudio Yacob in a central position. The Albion midfielder was already on a yellow but Taylor judged that it was an unintentional foul.Just as West Brom were beginning to look dangerous, Chelsea struck again. Cesc Fàbregas threaded a ball through to Willian, whose low cross was intended for the onrushing Kenedy. The Brazilian surged towards the near post and slid in to finish, but the last touch came off McAuley.However, Chelsea’s lead was once more cancelled out. In the 86th minute Gardner swept the ball infield and it fell to McClean 20 yards out. The midfielder zipped a low shot past Thibaut Courtois and into the bottom corner.Pulis said: “We just felt there were certain things to do during the game that might cause them problems. We didn’t want to sit, we wanted to press. I think that’s the fourth time where we’ve come from behind to get something from the game. That’s good character and spirit.”

Stoke make light work of 10-man Norwich after Gary O’Neil is sent off
~~AUTHOR~~
Paul Wilson
~CONTENTS~
Stoke City continue to climb the table as well as contest the Capital One Cup, though thanks to a late own goal and a particularly brainless Norwich dismissal they found three points easier to come by than might have been expected against relegation-threatened opponents.Norwich managed to come back once after Gary O’Neil’s daft first-half offence, felling Ibrahim Afellay just as the ball was running out of play, but the odds on a second recovery became impossible when Ryan Bennett headed a free-kick beyond his own goalkeeper 12 minutes from time.“We’ve fluffed our lines a couple of times recently so that could be a key result for us,” Mark Hughes said on seeing his side move up to seventh.PosTeamPGDPts6Man Utd217347Stoke212328Crystal Palace21331“We are roughly where we want to be in the table, the rest of the season will be about digging in and seeing if we can get any higher.”Stoke could have opened the scoring inside 10 minutes when Joselu and Marko Arnautovic combined to break clear from halfway. The former’s return pass was a perfectly weighted chip that virtually invited Arnautovic to shoot without breaking stride, though the effort lacked conviction and Declan Rudd was able to push the ball round his right-hand post.After Jonny Howson had recorded Norwich’s first effort with an ambitious drive that cleared Jack Butland’s bar Arnautovic was involved again, finding space on the left to send in a cross to the near post that Jon Walters met without managing to hit the target. Joselu came closest to breaking the deadlock before the interval when he stole in to reach a reverse pass from Arnautovic only to put his shot the wrong side of a post.Norwich looking to spend £8m fee for Lewis Grabban on new players Read moreNorwich had two chances to go in front before unnecessarily handicapping themselves. Butland gifted them the first, finding only Wes Hoolahan with a poor clearance then watching in relief as the midfielder’s shot from distance passed safely clear of an unguarded goal. He atoned with a point-blank save from Bennett following a corner. While a striker might have made more of the chance Butland was equal to the defender’s attempt, and Stoke were left to rue their missed opportunities when O’Neil was sent off moments later.Despite a furious crowd reaction and Hughes leaping out of his dugout to express his own displeasure the Norwich player’s challenge on Afellay was probably not as bad as it looked. There was absolutely no need for O’Neil to steam in with a scissors-type tackle as Affellay shepherded the ball across the touchline, and though the challenge was more senseless than dangerous there were few grumbles at a straight red. “It was a bad decision, but from Gary,” Alex Neil said. “It was completely out of character, he apologised at the interval, but it cost us.”Stoke failed to make their numerical superiority count before half-time but took the lead four minutes after the restart with a trademark Walters goal. Arnautovic was nearly dispossessed by Vadis Odjidja-Ofoe in the build-up on the left flank, though when the ball rebounded back to him he hit a sumptuous first-time cross met at the far post with practised ease by Walters, recalled to the side because Xherdan Shaqiri faces a fortnight out after straining a hamstring in training.The visitors had not ventured out of their own half by that stage of the second half, though when they finally crossed the halfway line they made it count at the first attempt. Throwing caution to the wind and a few bodies up front, Hoolahan’s cross was neatly chested back by Odjidja-Ofoe for Howson to have a crack from the edge of the area, and the midfielder produced an unstoppable drive that Butland had no chance of keeping out.That briefly set up a contest, with the Norwich fans chanting: “We’ve only got 10 men,” before Joselu restored the home side’s lead midway through the second half, finding Rudd’s bottom-right corner with a right-foot shot after taking a pass from Afellay on the edge of the area.The influential Afellay also supplied the free-kick from which Bennett scored the final goal, as well as the corner that saw Peter Crouch bring a late save from Rudd to prevent Stoke making it four.

Shane Long and Dusan Tadic give Southampton vital win over Watford
~~AUTHOR~~
Alan Smith
~CONTENTS~
This was more like the Southampton we have come to expect. After a miserable recent run, they returned to winning ways courtesy of a barnstorming performance against an off-colour Watford. Shane Long and Dusan Tadic struck in either half but the scoreline was not a fair reflection of their complete dominance.It could easily have been five and Fraser Forster, between the home posts for the first time in 10 months after recovering from a knee injury, enjoyed such an undemanding return it was not until the 85th minute that he had to make a routine save.Having won only once in the previous 10 games, the Southampton manager, Ronald Koeman, had conceded beforehand that he was peering down the table, concerned about being dragged into an unlikely relegation battle. There was an indubitable sense of relief at full-time but Koeman said he will still be looking over his shoulder. “We can look up but we also have to look under because it is close,” he said.PosTeamPGDPts11Everton2172812Southampton2142713West Brom21-527Southampton had been the better team in many of those recent games only for profligate finishing and defensive errors to prove costly. While they spurned several opportunities here, allowing tension to creep in before Tadic scored the second 17 minutes from time, their three centre-halves did not allow the Watford strikeforce of Odion Ighalo and Troy Deeney a sniff.“We know sometimes we need to be more clinical but I’m very pleased by the whole team performance,” Koeman said. “It was a high level against a strong opponent. After a lot of defeats maybe the team were a little nervous but we showed our quality from the start.”As in previous games Southampton started promisingly but there was a crucial difference: they took the lead with their first clear opportunity. And what a move it was. Matt Targett, making his first league appearance since October at left wing-back, provided an exquisite cross for Long. The Republic of Ireland striker still had plenty of work to do, though, rising in front of Miguel Britos to direct a clinical header into the bottom right corner.Four minutes later the advantage should have been doubled when Sadio Mané danced down the left, turned Sebastian Prödl inside out and back again before shooting goalwards from the ‘D’. Heurelho Gomes, however, got a firm hand to the shot and turned it round his left post for a corner. From the ensuing delivery the ball was recycled to Targett and his effort was deflected wide.Quique Sánchez Flores: Watford interested in Andros Townsend Read moreWatford were uncharacteristically slack, leaving the head coach, Quique Sánchez Flores, to admit “we were not competitive”. They should have been punished in the 36th minute when José Manuel Jurado played an astoundingly poor pass across the back towards Prödl. Mané was too quick for the Austria defender, stealing possession only for a low shot to beat the advancing Gomes but not the woodwork.Gomes also had to race off his line to take the ball from Mané’s feet from a tight angle and the away team were quite fortunate not to be dead and buried by the interval, only still in the game thanks to their keeper.“I am not angry, but disappointed,” said Flores. “We made it easy for Southampton. They were much better than us, and we played in a different way than usual. It was the first time our opponent has been much better than us.”Mané’s duel with Gomes continued into the second half when they collided again while vying for a deflected Targett cross. Gomes came off worse, requiring several minutes’ attention to a head injury before being judged OK to continue. Mané got to the ball first but was denied by Prödl on the line.Southampton’s dominance continued but they wasted several good chances to kill the game off. Oriol Romeu shot hard and low only for Gomes to save, a Virgil van Dijk pull-back from a Davis free-kick somehow evaded both a sliding Long and Mané, and the latter also shot wide after being teed up by Long.Nerves were evidently seeping in around the ground but Mané was replaced after that miss and his replacement, Tadic, ensured the points with his first piece of action, composing himself just inside the area and giving Gomes no chance with a precise left-footed finish after Steven Davis’s headed pass.

Chelsea given smaller PSG ticket allocation due to Paris security fears
~~AUTHOR~~
Guardian sport
~CONTENTS~
Chelsea have had their ticket allocation for their Champions League last-16 match with Paris Saint-Germain cut because of the heightened security level in the French capital and the behaviour of their fans last year.In a statement on the club’s website, Chelsea said their allocation for the match on 16 February will be 1,400, 800 fewer than last season. Away supporters for domestic matches in France have not been allowed since November’s terrorist attacks in Paris.MIA tells PSG football club to see the 'bigger picture' over Borders dispute Read moreChelsea made representations to have the allocation restored to the normal level but were denied because of the trouble in Paris last year, when supporters were alleged to have pushed a black man off the Paris Métro while chanting: “We’re racist and that’s the way we like it.”A statement on the club’s website read: “With a heightened security situation in France ongoing, Chelsea Football Club has been advised by French authorities that we are to receive a smaller allocation of tickets for our supporters to attend the Champions League game away to Paris Saint-Germain on 16th February compared with our allocation for the similar match during the previous two seasons.“The club will receive 1,400 tickets for next month’s game and, although a year ago we received 2,100 tickets, the reduced number does compare favourably with other clubs playing Champions League games this season at Parc des Princes. Ajax and Anderlecht were given approximately 800 tickets for their most recent games there. Away supporters at domestic league matches in Paris are not allowed following November’s terrorist attacks.“While we are disappointed that not all our fans who want to go to the game will now be able to attend, we appreciate the Parisien authorities are operating in a heightened security environment.“Chelsea met with Paris police (including their commissioner), Uefa and our counterparts from PSG and made representations for the proposed ticket allocation to be set at previous levels. The club made our best effort to obtain the full allocation but was advised it would not be possible due to issues that occurred with Chelsea fans in the Paris tube and elsewhere last year, in addition to the ongoing security situation.”

FA makes Baroness Sue Campbell new head of women’s football

~CONTENTS~
The FA has named Baroness Sue Campbell, the former chair of UK Sport, as its new head of women’s football.Baroness Campbell’s appointment is made at a time when the sport is enjoying an upsurge in popularity after England’s third-placed finish at the 2015 Women’s World Cup. She will take on the FA’s drive to increase grassroots participation in girls’ and women’s football, with the goal of generating further success among the country’s elite women’s teams.England Women to play in inaugural SheBelieves Cup Read moreA former England netball player and coach, Baroness Campbell assumed her position at UK Sport in 2003, a year in which she also received a CBE for her services to sport. In that role, she was responsible for the strategies that led to Team GB’s record-breaking performance at the London 2012 Olympics and Paralympics.Kelly Simmons, the FA’s director of participation and development, said that Campbell’s arrival is a statement of intent from the organisation. “I’m delighted that Baroness Campbell is joining us and am really looking forward to working with her laying the foundations for growth across the women’s game,” Simmons said.“Sue is widely regarded as one of the most influential people in British sport. This appointment is a massive statement about the FA’s ambitions for the women’s game and where the game is at.”Baroness Campbell – who is also chair of the Youth Sport Trust, with which she has been involved since the charity’s inception – said that her task would be to further the progress already made in increasing the strength of the women’s game.“I am really excited about the opportunity to help shape the future vision and strategy for girls and women’s football,” she said.“Great strides have already been made both in terms of grassroots participation and at the elite level. The growth of the FA Women’s Super League and success of the England Lionesses are testimony to that. I am really looking forward to building on the work already done.”The improvement in the England senior team’s standing was confirmed earlier this week when it was announced that they will travel to America to play USA, Germany and France in the high-profile SheBelieves Cup this March.

Andy Carroll is anxiously awaiting the results of a scan on the hamstring injury he suffered at Bournemouth on Tuesday but the early indication is the West Ham United striker will be out for between four and six weeks.Carroll has been beset by serious injuries to his heel, ankle and knee since he joined West Ham from Liverpool in January 2013 for £15m. The club will not know what the scan has shown until Thursday.Enner Valencia strikes twice as West Ham hit back to beat Bournemouth Read moreHe was forced off after 15 minutes of the 3-1 win at Bournemouth and the 27-year-old has been able to start only 31 Premier League matches for West Ham.He had returned over the Christmas period from a groin injury and there had been positive signs, not least the goals in the home wins over Southampton and Liverpool.Slaven Bilic said: “It is a really bad situation for us. After the Liverpool win, I said he is back, he looked sharp, he looked strong and he was covering the whole pitch and terrorising the defenders. So it is a blow.” The West Ham manager added: “He is disappointed because he knows he is back but if we have to choose between a knee and a hamstring injury, it is better to have a hamstring injury.”Bilic is already without another key striker, Diafra Sakho, who tore his thigh muscle against West Bromwich Albion on 29 November. He returned to the training ground last week after a period of limited rehabilitation and the club will have a better idea of when he will be ready to play again at the end of this week. It will certainly not be before February.West Ham may now cancel plans to listen to offers for Nikica Jelavic or Mauro Zárate during the transfer window.

John Sheridan returns to Oldham Athletic after leaving Newport County
~CONTENTS~
Oldham have appointed John Sheridan as manager for a second time. Sheridan, who held the job there between 2006 and 2009, has returned as David Dunn’s successor after an agreement was reached with Newport.The Welsh side, in League Two, granted Oldham permission to holds talks on Tuesday with Sheridan, who took over as Newport’s manager only in early October.“John has always been high up on my list whenever we have appointed managers,” said the Latics chairman Simon Corney. “If you look at his record, he got us into the play-offs when he was here and he has won the Johnstone’s Paint Trophy and promotion with Chesterfield, plus he took Plymouth into the play-offs last season.“Wherever he has been he has done really well. It was time to make a change and we feel we’ve got the right man here to make a difference, get the crowd going, get the players going and keep us in League One. I would also like to take this opportunity to add my thanks to Newport County who have dealt with this situation in a professional manner.”After Newport’s FA Cup match against Blackburn was postponed on Saturday when heavy rain made the Rodney Parade pitch unplayable, Sheridan criticised his then club for not doing enough to ensure the game went ahead. The ground’s head of operations, Mark Jones, called his comments “very unprofessional” and later accepted an apology from him.Oldham sacked Dunn this week just four months into his tenure, after he secured only three wins. Sheridan replaced Terry Butcher as the Newport manager in October and has led the club to five victories from his 17 matches in charge. The 51-year-old made more than 150 appearances for Oldham during his playing career. The Newport assistant manager, Warren Feeney, and the first-team coach, Mike Flynn, will be in charge of the side for Saturday’s trip to York.

A 48-hour turps bender
~~AUTHOR~~
Scott Murray
~CONTENTS~
POZZO > LEVEIN > FRAEYECharlton interim manager Karel Fraeye bears a slight facial resemblance to former Scotland coach Craig Levein. He’s not the spitting image of him or anything, but there’s a vague, ballpark similarity going on there. It’s more pronounced if you search out a picture of Fraeye wearing a pair of expensive designer spectacles, frowning quite hard, holding his head in his hands like he’s just off the back of a 48-hour turps bender, and staring at the floor while wearing the dazed look of a man who can’t for the life of him figure out how to break down Liechtenstein. Squint a little. Squint a lot. There! They’re not a million miles apart, are they? Although sadly for Charlton, the comparison ends there, because Fraeye’s results are so bad they make Levein look like Vittorio Pozzo.Since taking over at the Valley in late October, Fraeye has masterminded just two wins in 14 games. Both of those came in November, since when his team have drawn four and lost six. The last two defeats were a 2-1 FA Cup loss at Colchester which could have been five, and a 5-0 thrashing at Huddersfield on Tuesday night which could have been 10. After being terrorised by the Terriers, Fraeye scuttled on to the team bus without saying a word, leaving his players to sweet-talk the media. Bad idea, because goalkeeper Stephen Henderson, after freely confessing to his own role in a couple of the goals, was, upon being asked about Fraeye’s future, forthright bordering on recklessly trenchant.“Does there have to be a change made?” he asked himself aloud. “Without a doubt. I’d like to apologise to our travelling fans. I know they think I won’t mean it but the real fans will know I genuinely want to apologise for that shocking performance.” Club captain Johnnie Jackson went one step further by pledging to reimburse the 166 travelling Charlton fans the £23 they each paid for their tickets.

~CONTENTS~
The former Colombia goalkeeper Faryd Mondragón was taken to hospital on Tuesday after reportedly attempting to kill himself.The Valle del Lili clinic in his home town of Cali confirmed that Mondragón, who became the oldest player at a World Cup in 2014, was admitted after suffering from a “metabolic imbalance”. The hospital later stated the 44-year-old “is in good condition and under medical observation”, although it did not say when he may be released.Louis van Gaal should ask Paul Scholes to be a Manchester United coach Read moreThe news came hours after Mondragón posted a concerning message on Instagram, which has since been deleted.“There is only me who can judge my life and I’m tired of being judged by others without the possibility of defending myself,” he wrote.Reports in the Colombian media suggested he had taken a large dose of antidepressants.At the age of 43 years and three days, Mondragón beat Roger Milla’s record for the oldest player to play in a World Cup finals match during Colombia’s 4-1 win over Japan. The former Real Zaragoza, Galatasaray and Metz goalkeeper has since retired from football and started working as a pundit last year.• In the UK, the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123

Pavel Srnicek memorial: Newcastle players, staff and fans pay tribute
~CONTENTS~
Tyneside turned out in force to pay its respects to the former Newcastle goalkeeper Pavel Srnicek in an emotional farewell.Hundreds of friends and fans joined family members at the Parish Church of St Andrew in the shadow of St James’ Park for a memorial service on Wednesday following Srnicek’s death last month at the age of 47.Former team-mates Alan Shearer, Steve Harper, Shay Given, Rob Lee, Lee Clark, Alan Thompson, Scott Sellars, Steve Howey, Darren Peacock, Steve Watson and Brian Kilcline were in attendance, as were the former chairmen Sir John Hall and Freddy Shepherd, the current managing director Lee Charnley, the manager Steve McClaren, the football development manager Peter Beardsley and the players Tim Krul and Steven Taylor.Harper, who was a 17-year-old aspiring keeper when he first met Srnicek, led the tributes. “You loved Newcastle, Pav, but I can assure you that Newcastle loved you,” he said. “It was a privilege to meet you, it was a privilege to learn from you, it was a privilege to know you and call you my friend.”Srnicek’s friend and agent Steve Wraith thanked those who had sent cards and best wishes to the Srnicek family in the Czech Republic on behalf of his mother Bernadette and brother Milan, who was present, and told the congregation of Srnicek’s love for the city and for the club he represented with such distinction.

Photograph: Michael Regan/Getty ImagesHe said: “He may have arrived without a Geordie accent or an inkling of what a Geordie was, but somehow, he got it. He was a gentleman and a Geordie and his place will be forever written into the history of Newcastle United. We love you Pavel, we do, oh Pavel we love you.”During the service, which was led by the club’s chaplain the Reverend Canon Glyn Evans, the congregation sang the FA Cup final hymn Abide With Me and the 23rd psalm, to which an extra verse had been added. It read: “Pavel is a Geordie evermore, He’s part of our family, He’s played in goal, God rest his soul, a Geordie like you and me.”The service also included some of Srnicek’s favourite songs, Gerry and the Pacemakers’ You’ll Never Walk Alone and Lifted by the Lighthouse Family, and ended with a recording of a Czech song, the title of which translates as Me and You.Shearer said: “It’s not surprising but it’s great to see so many old faces. People have come from all over the world, all over the country to be here, and that tells you what a nice, genuine, humble, honest, hard-working professional Pav was. He was great to be around.”

Russian TV commentator sacked after snoozing during Barcelona match
~~AUTHOR~~
Guardian sport
~CONTENTS~
Some pundits have described the current Barcelona teams as the best of all time but even watching the likes of Lionel Messi and Neymar was not enough to keep one Russian TV commentator awake.Vasily Utkin – one of the lead commentators for the new Russian state sports broadcaster Match TV created by President Vladimir Putin last year – was watching Luis Enrique’s side face Bayer Leverkusen in a Champions League tie in December when he accidentally dozed off at the end of the first half of the 1-1 draw. Utkin has now been suspended despite the fact that he claims to suffer from a chronic sleep disorder.Time to deliver: Jonjo Shelvey enters the last chance saloon at Newcastle Read more“I am convinced that [the suspension] is due to this commentary in the game between Bayer and Barça. But I wasn’t spoken to just about this game,” he told the TASS agency.“I can explain what happened in the match. For a few years, I’ve been suffering from chronic sleep disorder. It just so happened that at the end of the first half, I fell asleep and I was talking in my sleep.“Naturally, it is very easy to understand that this is the case, because in the second half there were no problems at all.”Utkin, 43 is a controversial figure in Russian football known for his outspoken comments. Last year, he openly criticised Match TV’s lead producer Tina Kandelaki on Twitter and said no one in Russia spoke about sports more “tritely, lamely and detestably.” Kandelaki responded by calling him “a fatso” before the pair eventually made up.Match TV is owned by the state energy giant Gazprom and recruited the producer Charles Coplin, a 52-year-old former executive for the NFL, NHL and ABC Sports, last year for its launch.

Louis van Gaal should ask Paul Scholes to be a Manchester United coach
~~AUTHOR~~
Paul Wilson
~CONTENTS~
Fair play to Louis van Gaal. The Manchester United manager does not duck questions and he does not hide from issues either. Not only did the Dutchman admit in words that Paul Scholes had a point about Manchester United being boring, he did something about it in the next game to produce something that was much more to supporters’ satisfaction. Well, neutral observers anyway. Whether United supporters could be completely happy with two points squandered at Newcastle is debatable, but they ought to have been happy at the way Van Gaal’s side lined up and went for the win.Wayne Rooney: Manchester United must find balance between defence and attack Read moreWithout Bastian Schweinsteiger through injury and Juan Mata through choice, Manchester United could hardly fail to be quicker and more direct, and the way Wayne Rooney and Jesse Lingard exploited space on the flanks for the second goal was a throwback to happier times. After his criticism on Saturday Scholes must have been bouncing up and down on his studio seat to see Manchester United take hold of the game in such thrilling fashion, and what Van Gaal would probably have liked to do at that point was send on Mata and Schweinsteiger to slow the game down again and keep control until the end.Boring, perhaps, but when you have taken a 2-0 lead away from home you have done enough entertaining. Protecting the result becomes the most important thing, especially for a controlling manager such as Van Gaal. But Schweinsteiger was unavailable and Newcastle were coming back into the game, so when Lingard needed to be replaced Van Gaal went uncharacteristically gung-ho and sent on Memphis Depay instead of Mata. Who knows, without Scholes’ comments he might not have made such an attacking switch, and it almost worked.Depay was involved in the third Manchester United goal, the one that looked like it was going to be the winner. Unfortunately he was also involved in the third Newcastle United goal, the one that left the visitors so deflated, which just goes to show that Van Gaal’s safety-first instincts are right some of the time. The very best teams hurt their opponents at the front at the same time as keeping things tight at the back. The old Manchester United used to be able to do that but the present side are not at the same level. With Manchester United at the moment it seems to be one thing or the other – unimaginative control or unguarded adventure – unless you get bits of both in the same game, as happened at Newcastle.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Paul Scholes, second right, has been a member of Manchester United’s coaching staff, including here under the interim manager Ryan Giggs, right, in 2014. Photograph: Matthew Peters/Man Utd via Getty ImagesManchester United will not win the league playing as they did at St James’ Park, although they were not going to win the league playing in their previous constipated fashion either, and there is no doubt which version spectators would rather watch. Funnily enough, the way Manchester United threw away their lead on Tyneside was a bit like watching Newcastle 20 years ago, when they used to score goals for fun under Kevin Keegan but give away just as many through comedy defending. Odd that, because by his own admission Keegan was not a master tactician as a coach; he just knew how he wanted to see the game played. Van Gaal does have a reputation as a tactical analyst, and reputedly he doesn’t really care how entertainingly his players perform as long as they carry out his instructions. Yet, and here’s the important bit, he is not completely immune to criticism and neither is he as stubborn as he is made out. Scholes called him out on Saturday. He did not just say his team played boring football he ventured to suggest that the manager himself must be finding it tedious too. Van Gaal could easily have brushed that charge aside; instead he accepted it. Then tried to do something about it.That should at least give pause to the Manchester United supporters who were beginning to find Scholes tedious. There are some out there, because after reporting the former midfielder’s comments following the Sheffield United Cup game at the weekend I was contacted by several people complaining that Scholes should change the record, that BT was only employing him to be negative, even that he was acting as a stooge for his old pal Sir Alex Ferguson and was daring to be so outspoken only because the danger of Manchester United bringing in José Mourinho now seemed to have receded.Paul Scholes: Manchester United performance at Newcastle ‘loads better’ Read morePerhaps the most outlandish suggestion was that Scholes is enjoying his five minutes of fame as an outspoken pundit, revelling in Manchester United’s disarray so that his pithy comments can form the next morning’s headlines. This must be a new version of Scholes then. In all his years as a player the Ginger Lad did not seem to be enjoying fame one bit. Even now on television he does not exactly make a grab for the microphone and gaze straight down the camera lens. He looks for all the world as if he has found himself in an awkward situation, and that is because he has. He looks as if he would far rather be singing the praises of Manchester United, admiring the audacity of their attacking play or bigging up the authority some of their big names bring to the midfield. Instead he has been forced to offer opinions on an absence of attacking play, a lack of midfield authority. While he does not look particularly chuffed at having to find words to describe some of the most pedestrian Manchester United performances in recent memory, to Scholes’ credit he is not going to pretend they have been anything else.Lancashire folk are known for plain speaking, no beating about the bush, and though Scholes is hardly a television natural BT has done well to find a pundit with both an opinion and a forthright way of expressing it. The interesting thing is that Dutch folk are known for plain speaking too. Van Gaal would be just as blunt and provocative were he operating as a pundit rather than attempting to hold the football side together as manager.He could not possibly disagree with Scholes’ comments about being bored, so he agreed with them. Although Van Gaal and Scholes are often thought of as being poles apart, with no common ground except Ryan Giggs occupying a rather uncomfortable space between them, the chances are their views are quite similar. Maybe – here’s a thought – Van Gaal should invite Scholes to rejoin the coaching staff. Better inside the tent etc. He stopped coaching last time only because Fergie asked him to come back as a player. He’s probably just about safe from that now.

Former Everton striker Marcus Bent facing prison over affray charge
~CONTENTS~
The former Premier League footballer Marcus Bent has been warned he faces a prison sentence after he admitted affray.The 37-year-old pleaded guilty at Guildford Crown Court, sitting at Guildford Magistrates’ Court, to the charge which stemmed from an incident at his Surrey home.Time to deliver: Jonjo Shelvey enters the last chance saloon at Newcastle Read moreThe ex-Ipswich, Everton and Charlton striker had previously entered a guilty plea to one count of possessing a class A drug - cocaine. Bent, dressed in a navy suit and white shirt, spoke only to confirm his name and enter his plea of guilty to affray.He was charged after an incident in which he was reportedly Tasered by police responding to reports of a break-in at his home in Claremont Lane in Esher, Surrey, on 13 September. The court heard that two charges of possessing bladed articles, namely a meat cleaver and a kitchen knife, would be left to lie on file.Lee Harris, prosecuting, said: “The Crown take the view that his intention and what was in his mind at the time is not a matter of law.”Judge Stephen Climie adjourned the case until next month, pending a probation report, but warned the former striker he is at risk of being jailed. The judge said: “I adjourn your case for sentence on 12 February. Between now and then, I expect the Probation Service to prepare a report on you which you are required to attend for interview to discuss in greater detail the background to what on paper is a disturbing set of events, which I’m sure you appreciate.“On the face of it a custodial sentence is justified. Whether that is the right sentence in the context of this case is not a matter I will prejudge.”Bent, from Esher, Surrey, was released on unconditional bail. The ex-England Under-21 international played 574 games and scored 113 goals during his professional career at 14 different clubs including Crystal Palace, Sheffield United and Blackburn.
